Mendelson</h3><p>Speaker on the Myth of Social Media</p></div><h4>Topics</h4><p>Academic Interest, Business, Communication, Humor, Outside the Box</p><h4>Travels From</h4><p>New York</p><h4>Bio</h4><p>B.J. Mendelson is a former marketer turned author, speaker, and entrepreneur. He opened his first business, Earth’s Temporary Solution, in his dorm room at Alfred State College shortly after the events of September 11th to encourage volunteerism and social service. Today B.J. tours college campuses across America and visits small businesses as a speaker to warn them about the myth of social media. Drawing on years of experience trying to use every new platform that emerged on the Internet since the ’90s to make enough money to retire, and failing horribly—B.J. educates and entertains audiences online and around the world. He previously toured college campuses across America as a speaker on college survival issues and a promoter of the early detection and prevention of breast cancer among college students.B.J. has been a syndicated college survival columnist with CBS College Sports’s former U-Wire division, and has been quoted and featured in <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Psychology Today</em>, <em>SmartMoney</em>magazine, and other national outlets. He has also contributed pieces for CNN, MTV, The Huffington Post, Mashable, Forbes, and the Eisner-nominated ComicsAlliance.
He formerly served as a new media director for a television show that aired in forty million homes through ABC affiliates across America, where he was often charged with coming up with online endeavors on the fly, to help grow the show’s audience. B.J. also built and operated the first Wounded Warriors Family Support High Five Tour, which features Colonel John Folsom traveling America in a custom Shelby Mustang to thank America for its support of our servicemen and women. The mustang was custom wrapped, creating an opportunity for people across America to sign the car during each of the Colonel’s tour stops. The High Five Tour recently entered its third year of successful operation and continues to emerge bigger and better each year.</p><h4>SPEECHES</h4><p><strong>Social Media Is Bullshit:</strong> B.J. discusses why money spent on "social media" is money wasted, and describes the world we live in today as a place where it’s far easier to make money telling people how to get rich using the Internet than it is to actually get rich using it. A brief reading from select parts of the book of the same name followed by some talking and then a lengthy Q & A session with the audience<br /><br/><strong>A National Story of Minor Significance:</strong> B.J. describes his transition from being a believer in the myth of social media to a critic and (hopeful) executioner of it—retelling the breast cancer tour which serves as the basis of Social Media Is Bullshit.<br /><br/><strong>Astonishing Tales of Mediocrity:</strong> Since age 16, B.J. has used every platform that’s come out on the Internet in an attempt to make himself rich. His goal was to always retire at 30, and this goal drove him to dive headfirst into the different platforms and marketing books, which lead him to discover that they were all recycling How To Win Friends And Influence People and the core lessons of that book, which are discussed and weaved throughout the presentation<br /><br/></p><h4>BOOKS</h4><p><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" border="0">

<p>&#8220;We were very excited to have Brandon as our guest speaker. His event was very insightful into one of the most popular “buzz words” in modern marketing. Brandon offered a different perspective on the advantages and disadvantages of social media and the impact it has on our lives and on business. Our members were able to learn something new about something we all use every day! Brandon did a fantastic job by engage the students and providing very thoughtful answers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As an expert on viral marketing, B.J. Mendelson knows how social media works and for whom it works. But more importantly, he knows why it won’t work for you. B.J.’s candid delivery cut through the bullshit to provide us with the truth about where we should really be putting our marketing dollars. It just adds to his credibility that B.J. wasn’t trying to sell us anything &#8211; his discussion was refreshingly void of a sales pitch for his book. This guy’s the real deal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While attending the Associated Collegiate Press Convention in San Francisco, I had the opportunity to hear Brandon Mendelson&#8217;s &#8220;People are Idiots&#8221; speech. His speech focused less on being a speech and more on being an interactive learning experience. It was really more of a seminar where audience members shared personal student newsroom struggles and then received advice and instruction from Mendelson. I not only enjoyed his speech, but I gained a lot of helpful advice from his answers to audience member questions. Mendelson made clear that learning how to work with the idiots in life is a necessity. He gave clear points for how to properly address issues brought on by the idiots of the work room, how to keep your cool, and how to handle the wide range of idiots. Whether dealing with disrespectful think-they-know-it-alls or lazy co-editors, Mendelson&#8217;s &#8220;People are Idiots&#8221; speech provides laughs and more importantly direction for handling the &#8220;you know who&#8221; of your work environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>—Mackenzie Foster, Student, Vanguard University of Southern California</p>

<p>“Brandon Mendelson’s unique history with Twitter made him an ideal speaker for MediaBistro’s first AllTwitter Marketing Conference. Often controversial and frequently polarising, B.J.’s session educated attendees on what does and, as often, does not work in social media, and included actionable takeaways on how they can apply these strategies (and avoid the pitfalls) within their own marketing campaigns. Funny and fearless, Brandon’s presentation ignited the show and got the audience – and the event hashtag – buzzing. I look forward to working with him again.”</p>
<p>—Shea Bennett, Editor AllTwitter.com, Planner/Host AllTwitter Marketing Conference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want to thank Brandon Mendelson for his reasoned, balanced and very professional approach to social media at the recent Westfair Communications debate on social media. It was clear that Brandon’s message resonated with a majority of the audience; many of them made that very clear after the program. He helped present one of the most successful events we have hosted to date.”</p>
<p>—Dee Delbello, Westfair Communications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Brandon Mendelson takes a karate chop to social media hype and offers a revealing analysis of what truly drives viral adoption of memes and media. Brandon is engaging, incredibly informative, and knows his stuff. My students and I were impressed with his depth of knowledge and ability to cut through the crap. None of us will look at companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter in the same light, complicit, as they are, in claiming that anyone can achieve stardom as long as they have the right idea. What Brandon shows is that there’s usually a lot of money and marketing muscle behind all the viral hits we see. It’s not fair, but it’s the way it is.”</p>
<p>—Adam L. Peneberg, New York University</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am thankful for the opportunity to have seen Brandon’s presentation at the Associated Collegiate Press convention. I’ve never encountered a speaker like him, with such a casual and inviting demeanor and a genuine desire to help to [us] students. Brandon was an incredibly compelling, honest speaker with useful and tactful advice for navigating through the world of journalism which, like the rest of the world, is rife with idiots.”</p>
<p>— Candice Oliver, Humboldt State University</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It was terrific to have Brandon speak to my Columbia Journalism School Social Media Skills course. His direct, provocative, sometimes counter-intuitive comments—all built on research and expertise—were widely welcomed and commented upon by my students. I look forward to welcome him back several times in the next few years.”</p>
<p>—Professor Sree Sreenivasan, Columbia University</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Brandon added a lot of color to our SXSW 2013 panel, which was a debate about whether marketing is B.S. [He] was a straight shooter, providing a unique voice amongst the other panelists who all represented specific brands and agencies. Brandon knew his material, cited facts, and wasn’t afraid to question the other panelists, which was important for the debate.”</p>
<p>—Matt Rozen, Corporate Social Media, Adobe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I had the distinct pleasure of having Brandon Mendelson speak with my graduate class at Columbia College Chicago. The presentation, and open discussion, centered around social media and viral advertising. The lecture provided invaluable information for the students and changed their minds about the best way to use social media and video channels. My students have requested he come speak again as soon as time permits. Brandon provides honestly, transparency, and rich case studies to outline his case for the proper use of social media. I am looking forward to future works from Brandon and regard him as a leader within the digital marketing space.”</p>
<p>– Alton J. Duderstadt II, Columbia College Chicago</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Social media is a topic on a lot of small business owners’ minds, and Mendelson’s personal experience and advice sparked what was by far our most exciting author Q&amp;A to date. Those present were shocked to discover how much of the time and energy they have invested in social media has most likely been for naught, and many had questions on what strategies make a real impact. Overall, Mendelson’s intriguing topic was a huge hit with our patrons and his personal touch, an offer of individual correspondence, left the audience feeling they had someone they could honestly turn to with their further concerns and ideas. “</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Brandon Mendelson and I locked horns in a debate over whether or not social media is, indeed, bullshit at Explore Portland in late 2012. The audience was shocked . . . because they learned so much and gained new perspective about the ins and outs of social media. Brandon brought a much needed perspective—that of the non-cheerleader—to an event full of ardent social media believers. While none turned away disbelievers, we all left with a better perspective of how and when social media marketing can be useful for businesses.”</p>
<p>—Jason Falls, SocialMediaExplorer.com and Vice President of Digital Strategy at Cafepress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In March of 2013, Brandon came ‘home’ to Alfred State College and was able to fit in time to speak to our students. The room was packed and the students were not disappointed. Brandon’s no-nonsense, personable delivery along with his wit and sense of humor created a memorable presentation. He has a presentation style that makes you want to listen and he couples that with real-world experience and evidence for a quality presentation. I can’t wait to read his next book!”</p>
<p>– Professor William Laubert, Alfred State College</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Brandon Mendelson’s] presentation was notable for his deep understanding of the changing media landscape and the challenges it faces, both in the short and long term. Representatives of Member States, media and civil society who attended the forum found the lively conversation highly relevant and useful.”</p>

<p>BJ was one of a dozen media professionals – which included editors of major publications and Pulitzer Prize winners – who met in small groups of select college journalists at the ACP Spring College Media Convention in San Francisco in March. BJ was the social media pro who counseled students about both their careers and their current social media practices. This first-ever event proved so popular, it ran way past its scheduled ending time.</p>
