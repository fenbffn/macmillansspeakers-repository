She is also a nutrition consultant and coach for the popular Daniel Plan, the inspirational health movement led by Pastor Rick Warren, and including Dr. Daniel Amen, Dr. Mark Hyman, and Dr. Mehmet Oz. Followers of The Daniel Plan lost more than 125 tons in 2011.

Working alongside her husband, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and physician, Daniel Amen, MD, Tana offers nutritional guidance and practical support to hundreds of thousands of Amen followers. Her book, <i>The Omni Diet</i>, is the culmination of her decade-long quest to study relationship between food and the body, and to understand how proper nutrition not only impacts weight loss, but actually holds the key to reversing chronic disease, decreasing inflammation, healing the body, and dramatically improving quality of life.

By the time she had reached her mid-30s, Tana Amen had nearly given up on good health. Through a lifetime of chronic medical ailments, including severe digestive issues, recurrent infections and, most devastatingly, a battle with thyroid cancer, there was never a point when Tana felt consistently healthy. Doctors ascribed her poor health to genetics, bad luck, and a family history of obesity and heart disease‚Äîbut even when Tana committed to a standard fitness and eating regimen, her health failed to improve. That‚Äôs when she realized that she needed to figure out how to improve her health . . . for good.

Tana‚Äôs fresh approach, her energetic presence, her enthusiastic style, and her ability to connect personally and directly with people‚Äîeven in large groups‚Äîhave made her an in-demand speaker. Tana has given dozens of presentations at the Saddleback Church, Superhero You, High Performance Brains, Women‚Äôs Wellness, the Institute for the Advancement of Human Behavior, the Omega Institute, Beacon House, Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center, The Want Institute, and other wellness-focused organizations.

She shares healthy eating tips in her newsletter and blog on <a href="http://www.tanaamen.com/">www.TanaAmen.com</a>, <i>The Huffington Post</i>, and Livestrong.com. She is also a coach on The Amen Solution online community and answers questions via her blog on <a href="http://www.amenclinics.com/">www.AmenClinics.com</a>.

Tana has played an important part in Dr. Amen‚Äôs astonishingly successful PBS specials, which have raised more than $45 million for public television and have made Daniel Amen one of the country‚Äôs most respected doctors.

&nbsp;

Known as the snarky voice behind the acclaimed sociopolitical blog The Sudanese Thinker‚Äîwhich he wrote anonymously until the revelation of his identity five years later during the Arab Uprisings of 2011‚ÄîAmir Ahmad Nasr has shared the stage with Nobel Peace Laureates, former presidents, and fellow social entrepreneurs, and has been featured by <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>, among many others.

&nbsp;

He is the author of the inspirational book <i>My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind‚Äìand Doubt Freed My Soul</i>, selected as one of <i>Foreign Policy</i>‚Äôs top 25 books to read in 2013. <i>My Isl@am</i> has been described by prominent media professor Clay Shirky as ‚Äúa love letter to freedom of speech,‚Äù and by graphic novelist G. Willow Wilson as a book that ‚Äúsheds light on a generation of revolutionary life-hackers poised to change the global conversation about religion and politics.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Nasr is a member of the invite-only US-based Young Entrepreneurs Council, and the (co)-founder and CEO of two start-ups in the field of personal development, on a mission to help instigate self-empowerment among his fellow Millennials through the power of online education, and entrepreneurship as a vehicle for change. From his previous underground digital activism to his wide-ranging work with innovative companies in the digital domain, Amir brings a unique integrated and enlightening perspective, and delivers it with engaging humor.

&nbsp;

His incisive input and digital media marketing strategies have helped his clients gain more clarity, generate more revenue, and create bigger impact. Dr. Mark Goulston, a renowned psychotherapist and Fortune 500 executive coach, describes Amir as ‚Äúone of the smartest and most trustworthy and finest human beings I have ever met,‚Äù and Michael Margolis, CEO of Get Storied, regards him as ‚Äúa rare breed, a marketing shaman for big ideas and important missions . . . .

An outspoken and deeply-respected legislator, noted for his keen sense of humor, Frank has played a key role in some of the most important legislation of our country‚Äôs recent history, including the repeal of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell.‚Äù

&nbsp;

As Chair of the House Financial Services Committee from 2007 to 2011, Frank helped craft the compromise bill to slow the tide of home mortgage foreclosures in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis, as well as the subsequent $550 billion rescue plan, and the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act‚Äîthe sweeping set of regulatory reforms named partly after Frank and signed into law in July 2010, to prevent the recurrence of the financial crisis.

&nbsp;

Frank also led the passage of the Credit Cardholders‚Äô Bill of Rights Act, a measure lauded by consumer advocates, and fought to preserve affordable rental housing, as well as to reduce military spending in favor of providing for important quality-of-life needs at home.

&nbsp;

Born Barnett Frank on March 31, 1940, in Bayonne, New Jersey to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe‚ÄîFrank‚Äôs parents were a truck stop owner and a legal secretary‚ÄîBarney Frank graduated from Harvard in 1962 and went on to pursue a Ph.D. He left before completing the degree to take a job as chief assistant to Boston Mayor Kevin White in 1968. Frank won a seat in the Massachusetts State Legislature in 1972, and though still closeted, went on to become a national leader of the LGBT rights movement, introducing the state‚Äôs first two gay rights bills in 1973.
In 1987, Frank became the first member of Congress to voluntarily come out as openly gay, and in 2012 he married his longtime partner Jim Ready, becoming the nation‚Äôs first congressman in a same-sex marriage while in office.

&nbsp;

Frank‚Äôs sixteen terms in Congress have left a legacy of civil rights and financial reform, and his abilities will be sorely missed. As noted by The Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúMr. Frank‚Äôs combative liberalism and quick wit make him a standout in a Capitol filled with politicians dependent on talking points and polls, a trait alluded to by Mr. Obama who said in a written statement that, ‚ÄòThe House of Representatives will not be the same without him.‚Äô‚Äù";s:10:"post_title";s:12:"Barney Frank";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:12:"barney-frank";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-04-29 16:56:47";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-04-29 16:56:47";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://www.macmillanspeakers.com/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=931";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"947";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"3";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2013-04-29 18:02:11";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2013-04-29 18:02:11";s:12:"post_content";s:2880:"Sergeant First Class Joseph Kapacziewski is the only amputee in Army Rangers history to return to combat, serving nine tours in the Middle East. Born in Durham, Connecticut, Kapacziewski enlisted in the United States Army in September 2001. He was two days from the end of a tour in Northern Iraq when his convoy was ambushed on October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2005‚Äîa grenade fell through the gunner‚Äôs hatch of the Stryker carrying him and exploded, shattering Kapacziewski‚Äôs right leg below the knee, damaging his right leg, and severing a nerve and an artery in his right arm.

&nbsp;

Kapacziewski spent seven months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and endured more than 40 surgeries, but when the leg would not heal as hoped, he chose to have it amputated with the goal of returning to service. He spent six months in physical therapy, learning to walk with a prosthetic, and re-qualified on Ranger physical standards by passing the Army Physical Fitness test: a 5-mile run in under 40 minutes, a 12-mile road march in less than 3 hours, fast rope out of a helicopter, and parachute with a combat load. SFC Kapacziewski was not only the first Ranger to return to the line with a prosthetic, he regained his squad leader position, was promoted to a platoon sergeant position, and has deployed to Afghanistan five times with the artificial limb. On May 24, 2011, he became the first enlisted soldier ever to receive the No Greater Sacrifice Freedom Award, given to individuals who epitomize selfless service to the nation.

&nbsp;

SFC Kapacziewski has deployed 10 times in total in support of the Global War on Terrorism, and his awards and decorations include: Bronze Star Medal with ‚ÄúV‚Äù device and (2 Oak Leaf Clusters), Meritorious Service Medal, Purple Heart ( 2nd Oak Leaf Clusters), 2 Army Commendation Medal with ‚ÄúV‚Äù device ( 2nd Oak Leaf Cluster) Army Achievement Medal (3rd Oak Leaf Cluster), Afghanistan Service Medal, Iraqi Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (with Arrowhead), Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Noncommissioned Officer Development Ribbon (with numeral 3), Overseas Service Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, the Army Good Conduct Medal (3rd Award), Ranger Tab, Senior Parachutist Badge (with Bronze Combat Jump Star), Expert Infantryman‚Äôs Badge, and the Combat Infantryman‚Äôs Badge.

&nbsp;

SFC Kapacziewski is married to the former Miss Kimberly Smithwick, from Moultrie, Georgia. They have two wonderful sons, Wyatt, 3 years of age and Cody, 2 years of age. Since losing his leg, Kapacziewski¬†has completed three triathlons and finished the New York Marathon twice.

His interdisciplinary research is accentuated in his inaugural book, <i>Beyond Cairo: US Engagement with the Muslim World.</i>

&nbsp;

As a part of Palgrave Macmillan‚Äôs Global Public Diplomacy Book Series, this book examines the U.S.‚Äôs once enthusiastic commitment to restore trusted relations with the Arab and larger Muslim world since President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2009 ‚ÄúNew Beginning‚Äù address in Cairo, Egypt.¬† This book tackles the problem with public diplomacy as the U.S. has been practicing it and provides a roadmap for the White House and State Department to re-engage the Muslim world over the coming years.

&nbsp;

As an expert in cross-cultural relations, Ezell writes widely on issues related to the Middle East and North African, human rights, ethnic conflict, and pop culture.¬† His human rights activism is featured in the John Fiege film, <i>Mississippi Chicken</i>, highlighting his advocacy for fair treatment of Latino poultry workers in rural Mississippi.

&nbsp;

Known by many as a captivating young man with an infectious gift to warm the core of any stranger, Ezell is inspired to participate in causes that build upon a legacy deriving from his family‚Äôs involvement in the Alabama Civil Rights Movement. In order to accomplish that successfully and unapologetically, he made his way to New York after 9/11 to study conflict resolution, pursuing a M.A. in Theology and Social Ethics at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University.¬† There he demonstrated his commitment to building bridges between religious and political leaders, first by working closely in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities in post-9/11 New York City with the Interfaith Center of New York and later in Chicago, IL at Interfaith Worker Justice.

&nbsp;

Garnering international attention while completing his Ph.D. in England, Ezell worked at the U.S. Department of State and the William J. Clinton Foundation (Clinton School of Public Service).

&nbsp;

He has been invited as a consultant to non-government organizations, think-tanks and universities on how best to manage global change. His sense of humor, knowledge, confidence, and passion combined make him captivating to media and live audiences alike. Ezell‚Äôs achievements in the United States and Europe have provided him a global platform as a dynamic speaker to deliver keynote addresses for international organizations, panel and workshop discussions at conferences, and lectures for academic institutions.

Patti Callahan Henry grew up in Philadelphia, the daughter of an Irish minister, and moved south with her family when she was 12 years old. With the idea that being a novelist was ‚Äúunrealistic,‚Äù she set her sights on becoming a pediatric nurse, graduating from Auburn University with a degree in nursing, and from Georgia State with a Master‚Äôs degree in Child Health. She left nursing to raise her first child, Meagan, and not long after having her third child, Rusk, she began writing down the stories that had always been in her head. Henry wrote early in the mornings, before her children woke for the day, but it wasn‚Äôt until Meagan, then six, told her mother that she wanted ‚Äúto be a writer of books‚Äù when she grew up, that Henry realized that writing was her own dream as well. She began taking writing classes at Emory University, attending weekend writers‚Äô conferences, and educating herself about the publishing industry, rising at 4:30 AM to write. Her first book, <i>Losing the Moon</i>, was published in 2004.¬†<i>¬†</i><i></i>";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"Patti Callahan Henry";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:20:"patti-callahan-henry";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-06-26 17:17:55";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-06-26 21:17:55";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://www.macmillanspeakers.com/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=973";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:9;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:4:"1000";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"3";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2013-05-07 17:01:46";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2013-05-07 17:01:46";s:12:"post_content";s:2684:"Amy Larkin is an award-winning environmental activist and entrepreneur, and has pioneered the connections between civic values and for-profit interests. Involved with Greenpeace for 30 years‚Äîas a Board member, advisor, and Director of Greenpeace Solutions from 2005 to 2011‚Äî her work was awarded the prestigious <b><a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/03/refrigerants-naturally-wins-2011-roy-award/" target="_blank">Roy Family </a></b>Award by Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government in 2011 for the Greenpeace collaboration with Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald‚Äôs, Unilever, and the UN Environment Programme‚Äîcalled <i>Refrigerants, Naturally!</i>

&nbsp;

The remarkable alliance began at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, after Greenpeace launched an attention-getting campaign with the slogan ‚ÄúGreen Olympics: Dirty Sponsors‚Äù to protest Coca-Cola‚Äôs and McDonald‚Äôs use of extremely harmful hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in commercial refrigeration installations. Coca-Cola, McDonald‚Äôs, and Unilever hosted a refrigeration summit that same year and their efforts eventually catalyzed a whole sector of corporations to adopt more climate-friendly refrigeration a decade later through the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), a consortium of 400 or the world‚Äôs largest brands and retailers. ¬†Larkin introduced this groundbreaking resolution to the CGF in 2010 and the organization agreed to begin replacing HFCs with natural refrigerants by 2015.
