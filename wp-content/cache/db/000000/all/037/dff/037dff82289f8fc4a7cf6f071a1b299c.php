"While attending the Associated Collegiate Press Convention in San Francisco, I had the opportunity to hear Brandon Mendelson's "People are Idiots" speech. His speech focused less on being a speech and more on being an interactive learning experience. It was really more of a seminar where audience members shared personal student newsroom struggles and then received advice and instruction from Mendelson. I not only enjoyed his speech, but I gained a lot of helpful advice from his answers to audience member questions. Mendelson made clear that learning how to work with the idiots in life is a necessity. He gave clear points for how to properly address issues brought on by the idiots of the work room, how to keep your cool, and how to handle the wide range of idiots. Whether dealing with disrespectful think-they-know-it-alls or lazy co-editors, Mendelson's "People are Idiots" speech provides laughs and more importantly direction for handling the "you know who" of your work environment."

‚ÄúBrandon Mendelson‚Äôs unique history with Twitter made him an ideal speaker for MediaBistro‚Äôs first AllTwitter Marketing Conference. Often controversial and frequently polarising, B.J.‚Äôs session educated attendees on what does and, as often, does not work in social media, and included actionable takeaways on how they can apply these strategies (and avoid the pitfalls) within their own marketing campaigns. Funny and fearless, Brandon‚Äôs presentation ignited the show and got the audience ‚Äì and the event hashtag ‚Äì buzzing. I look forward to working with him again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to thank Brandon Mendelson for his reasoned, balanced and very professional approach to social media at the recent Westfair Communications debate on social media. It was clear that Brandon‚Äôs message resonated with a majority of the audience; many of them made that very clear after the program. He helped present one of the most successful events we have hosted to date.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrandon Mendelson takes a karate chop to social media hype and offers a revealing analysis of what truly drives viral adoption of memes and media. Brandon is engaging, incredibly informative, and knows his stuff. My students and I were impressed with his depth of knowledge and ability to cut through the crap. None of us will look at companies like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter in the same light, complicit, as they are, in claiming that anyone can achieve stardom as long as they have the right idea. What Brandon shows is that there‚Äôs usually a lot of money and marketing muscle behind all the viral hits we see. It‚Äôs not fair, but it‚Äôs the way it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am thankful for the opportunity to have seen Brandon‚Äôs presentation at the Associated Collegiate Press convention. I‚Äôve never encountered a speaker like him, with such a casual and inviting demeanor and a genuine desire to help to [us] students. Brandon was an incredibly compelling, honest speaker with useful and tactful advice for navigating through the world of journalism which, like the rest of the world, is rife with idiots.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was terrific to have Brandon speak to my Columbia Journalism School Social Media Skills course.

I look forward to welcome him back several times in the next few years.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrandon added a lot of color to our SXSW 2013 panel, which was a debate about whether marketing is B.S. [He] was a straight shooter, providing a unique voice amongst the other panelists who all represented specific brands and agencies. Brandon knew his material, cited facts, and wasn‚Äôt afraid to question the other panelists, which was important for the debate.‚Äù

‚ÄúI had the distinct pleasure of having Brandon Mendelson speak with my graduate class at Columbia College Chicago. The presentation, and open discussion, centered around social media and viral advertising. The lecture provided invaluable information for the students and changed their minds about the best way to use social media and video channels. My students have requested he come speak again as soon as time permits. Brandon provides honestly, transparency, and rich case studies to outline his case for the proper use of social media. I am looking forward to future works from Brandon and regard him as a leader within the digital marketing space.‚Äù

‚ÄúSocial media is a topic on a lot of small business owners‚Äô minds, and Mendelson‚Äôs personal experience and advice sparked what was by far our most exciting author Q&amp;A to date. Those present were shocked to discover how much of the time and energy they have invested in social media has most likely been for naught, and many had questions on what strategies make a real impact. Overall, Mendelson‚Äôs intriguing topic was a huge hit with our patrons and his personal touch, an offer of individual correspondence, left the audience feeling they had someone they could honestly turn to with their further concerns and ideas. ‚Äú

‚ÄúBrandon Mendelson and I locked horns in a debate over whether or not social media is, indeed, bullshit at Explore Portland in late 2012. The audience was shocked . . . because they learned so much and gained new perspective about the ins and outs of social media. Brandon brought a much needed perspective‚Äîthat of the non-cheerleader‚Äîto an event full of ardent social media believers. While none turned away disbelievers, we all left with a better perspective of how and when social media marketing can be useful for businesses.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn March of 2013, Brandon came ‚Äòhome‚Äô to Alfred State College and was able to fit in time to speak to our students. The room was packed and the students were not disappointed. Brandon‚Äôs no-nonsense, personable delivery along with his wit and sense of humor created a memorable presentation. He has a presentation style that makes you want to listen and he couples that with real-world experience and evidence for a quality presentation. I can‚Äôt wait to read his next book!‚Äù

‚Äú[Brandon Mendelson‚Äôs] presentation was notable for his deep understanding of the changing media landscape and the challenges it faces, both in the short and long term.
