Hotchner is the author of 18 books, including <i>Papa Hemingway</i>, the 1966 internationally bestselling biography of his close friend Ernest Hemingway, and the memoir <i>King of the Hill</i>, which was adapted into the 1993 film by Steven Soderbergh. He is co-founder, with Paul Newman, of Newman‚Äôs Own Foods, which generates millions of dollars for charities, every year.

&nbsp;

Mr. ¬†Hotchner was born and raised in St. Louis where he received his LL.B, Doctor of Law, at Washington University. After practicing law for two years, Hotchner entered the Air Force, served with the Anti-Submarine command and emerged four years later a Major.

&nbsp;

Hotchner did not return to his practice in St. Louis, but instead settled in New York City, where, as a freelance writer, he wrote more than 300 articles and short stories for such publications as <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>Reader‚Äôs Digest</i>. During the golden days of television, when <i>Playhouse 90</i> flourished, he wrote a series of distinguished plays, including prize-wining adaptations of Ernest Hemingway‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Killers,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Fifth Column.‚Äù He wrote the screenplay for <i>Adventures of a Young Man</i>, which starred Paul Newman.

&nbsp;

Hotchner wrote about his long friendship with Hemingway in <i>Papa Hemingway</i>, and the highly acclaimed bestseller was published in 34 countries in 28 different languages. Mr. Hotchner has also written bestselling biographies of Doris Day and Sophia Loren. Two of Hotchner‚Äôs several novels, <i>The Man Who Lived at the Ritz</i>, and <i>Looking for Miracles</i>, were dramatized on television, and his memoir of his St. Louis boyhood, <i>King of the Hill</i>, was produced as a feature film. Hotchner also wrote <i>Blown Away</i>, a book about the Sixties and the Rolling Stones; an historical novel, <i>Louisiana Purchase</i>; a World War II memoir, <i>The Day I Fired Alan Ladd</i>; <i>Everyone Comes to Elaine‚Äôs</i>; <i>Dear Ernest, Dear Hotch</i>; <i>The Boyhood Memoirs of A.E. Hotchner</i>; and <i>Paul and Me</i>.

&nbsp;

Hotchner has also written for the theater. His play, <i>The White House</i>, starring Helen Hayes, was performed on Broadway, and in 1996, was performed in the East Room of the White House for President and Mrs. Clinton and an audience of distinguished guests. In 1993, a musical comedy which Hotchner wrote with Cy Coleman, <i>Welcome to the Club</i>, was also performed on Broadway. In addition, Hotchner wrote <i>A Short Happy Life with Rod Steiger</i>; <i>The Hemingway Hero</i>, which starred Gary Merrill, and <i>Sweet Prince</i>, starring Keir Dullea. A new musical he wrote with composer Cy Coleman, <i>Exactly Like You</i>, was performed at New York‚Äôs York theatre in 1999, and <i>Lawyers, Lovers &amp; Lunatics</i>, also written with Coleman, was performed in 2003.

&nbsp;

Along with his writing career, Hotch‚Äôs accidental business venture with his long-time friend Paul Newman (whose first starring role was in ‚ÄúThe Battler,‚Äù Hotchner‚Äôs first TV play) has turned into one of the country‚Äôs surprising success stories. Their ‚ÄúNewman‚Äôs Own‚Äù products generate millions of dollars of annual profit which is entirely contributed to a long list of deserving charities. One of the beneficiaries is the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, which they built in Connecticut for children with cancer and other life-threatening diseases. They have sponsored sister camps in Florida, New York State, California, North Carolina, and internationally in France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Hungary, and Africa.";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"A.E.

<div></div>
<div>U.S. Air Force fighter pilot James D. Murphy had always regarded military principles as applicable to successful businesses. In 1989, as he endured 18 months of intensive training, he realized that the process the Air Force employed to train him so quickly and efficiently could be used for corporations as well. The foundation for Flawless Execution was set.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After leaving active duty, Murphy boosted the sales of a small paint company from $5 million to $52 million in less than three years using the Flawless Execution ideology. He consequently established his own company, Afterburner Inc. in 1996. Murphy and his team of elite fighter pilots delivered their Plan-Brief-Execute-Debrief cycle to companies all over the world through keynote speeches and team-building seminars. By 2003, Inc. Magazine had mentioned Afterburner on their 500 List of America‚Äôs Fastest Growing Private Companies twice.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 2005, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel John A. Warden III trained Murphy in his Prometheus Process, which was the plan behind Instant Thunder, the successful air campaign against Saddam Hussein in 1990. Using principles from the Prometheus Process, Murphy completed the final model of Flawless Execution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Murphy has authored two books: <em>Business is Combat</em> and <em>Flawless Execution</em>. Murphy and the Afterburner company appear regularly in publications such as Newsweek, Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal, and have been featured on CNN, CNBC, and Fox News.</div>

Today, Afterburner Inc. heads various training programs and consulting services for corporations. Afterburner Inc has delivered its services to approximately 23% of the U.S. Fortune 500, businesses in 34 countries, and many Global Fortune 1000 companies.

He was accepted, and in 1979 began what would become his professional training. In 1980, he was cast in the daytime TV series "The Doctors" on NBC and has worked in nearly every venue as a professional actor ever since.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whether in regional theater or on Saturday Night Live, blockbuster movies or Broadway, literary festivals or television mini-series, Alec has always attempted to balance his love of communicating with an audience with the demands of a motion picture and television career.</div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div>On television, Baldwin is currently starring in NBC's Emmy award winning comedy series, "30 ROCK," for which he received the 2007 Golden Globe, SAG and Television Critics Association awards as Best Actor in a comedy. Baldwin has starred on "Knot's Landing" for CBS and numerous other TV shows including "Dress Grey" (a miniseries for NBC), "Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial (for TNT) and appearances on "Saturday Night Live" (too many to count).</div>
<div></div>
<div>His production company, El Dorado Pictures, has produced such films as "The Confession" (for Showtime) which won the Writer's Guild Award for Best Original Screenplay and David Mamet's "State and Main," among others.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Alec is an out-spoken supporter of various causes related to public policy, including environmentalism, the government's support of the arts, campaign finance reform, animal rights and gun control.

Best-selling author Alvin Townley risked everything on a dream when he embarked on a odyssey to discover stories of leadership, service, and adventure with a higher purpose. His travels have taken him around the world and led to his nationally-acclaimed books, Legacy of Honor, Spirit of Adventure, and Fly Navy.

Alvin‚Äôs adventure truly began when he quit his job and sold his house to travel the country and write his first book. His pursuit of inspiration has since taken him to the halls of Congress, deep into Africa, into the skies over the Arabian Sea, through Pacific coral reefs, to Rocky Mountain peaks, into corporate board rooms, and onto five aircraft carriers in three oceans.

Townley has spent three years traveling throughout the country and around the world to explore the legacy of Scouting.¬† In an adventure spanning thousands of miles, he has met with adventurers and leaders from every field, all Eagle Scouts. In 2007, St. Martin‚Äôs Press released his widely-acclaimed first book, <em>Legacy of Honor</em>.

To write <em>Legacy of Honor</em>, Alvin sold his home and left his job to travel the country and discover the legacy of America‚Äôs Eagle Scouts.¬†Among those he met were Michael Bloomberg, Ross Perot, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, J.W. Marriott, Jr., and Jim Lovell of Apollo 13. He also met a Tuskegee Airman, a POW from Vietnam, a September 11 NYPD hero, a crew of Hurricane Katrina relief workers, Navy SEALs, Olympians¬†and a host of others.

About <em>Legacy of Honor</em>, President Jimmy Carter said, ‚ÄúThese Eagle Scouts will inspire readers to become leaders in serving others.‚Äù Defense Secretary Robert Gates called the book ‚Äúinspirational.‚Äù

Since the book‚Äôs publication, Alvin has traveled coast-to-coast speaking to thousands about Scouting, character, and leadership.¬† In researching his second book, <em>Spirit of Adventure</em>, he circled the world, diving in Australia, surfing in Hawaii, rock climbing in Nevada, working with Peace Corps volunteers in Africa, and cruising aboard the aircraft carrier <em>USS Nimitz</em>.

An Eagle Scout himself, Alvin graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, interned in the U.S. House of Representatives, served on the executive staff of an 85,000-person international consulting firm, and coached high school track and field.¬†His presentations have inspired thousands of people in more than seventy cities across North America.He lives in his hometown of Atlanta.

&nbsp;

Known as the snarky voice behind the acclaimed sociopolitical blog The Sudanese Thinker‚Äîwhich he wrote anonymously until the revelation of his identity five years later during the Arab Uprisings of 2011‚ÄîAmir Ahmad Nasr has shared the stage with Nobel Peace Laureates, former presidents, and fellow social entrepreneurs, and has been featured by <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and <i>The Economist</i>, among many others.

&nbsp;

He is the author of the inspirational book <i>My Isl@m: How Fundamentalism Stole My Mind‚Äìand Doubt Freed My Soul</i>, selected as one of <i>Foreign Policy</i>‚Äôs top 25 books to read in 2013. <i>My Isl@am</i> has been described by prominent media professor Clay Shirky as ‚Äúa love letter to freedom of speech,‚Äù and by graphic novelist G. Willow Wilson as a book that ‚Äúsheds light on a generation of revolutionary life-hackers poised to change the global conversation about religion and politics.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Nasr is a member of the invite-only US-based Young Entrepreneurs Council, and the (co)-founder and CEO of two start-ups in the field of personal development, on a mission to help instigate self-empowerment among his fellow Millennials through the power of online education, and entrepreneurship as a vehicle for change. From his previous underground digital activism to his wide-ranging work with innovative companies in the digital domain, Amir brings a unique integrated and enlightening perspective, and delivers it with engaging humor.

&nbsp;

His incisive input and digital media marketing strategies have helped his clients gain more clarity, generate more revenue, and create bigger impact. Dr. Mark Goulston, a renowned psychotherapist and Fortune 500 executive coach, describes Amir as ‚Äúone of the smartest and most trustworthy and finest human beings I have ever met,‚Äù and Michael Margolis, CEO of Get Storied, regards him as ‚Äúa rare breed, a marketing shaman for big ideas and important missions . . . .

Involved with Greenpeace for 30 years‚Äîas a Board member, advisor, and Director of Greenpeace Solutions from 2005 to 2011‚Äî her work was awarded the prestigious <b><a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/03/refrigerants-naturally-wins-2011-roy-award/" target="_blank">Roy Family </a></b>Award by Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government in 2011 for the Greenpeace collaboration with Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald‚Äôs, Unilever, and the UN Environment Programme‚Äîcalled <i>Refrigerants, Naturally!</i>

&nbsp;

The remarkable alliance began at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, after Greenpeace launched an attention-getting campaign with the slogan ‚ÄúGreen Olympics: Dirty Sponsors‚Äù to protest Coca-Cola‚Äôs and McDonald‚Äôs use of extremely harmful hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in commercial refrigeration installations. Coca-Cola, McDonald‚Äôs, and Unilever hosted a refrigeration summit that same year and their efforts eventually catalyzed a whole sector of corporations to adopt more climate-friendly refrigeration a decade later through the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), a consortium of 400 or the world‚Äôs largest brands and retailers. ¬†Larkin introduced this groundbreaking resolution to the CGF in 2010 and the organization agreed to begin replacing HFCs with natural refrigerants by 2015.

&nbsp;

Larkin was President and Co-founder of Message!Check Corp., one of the first affinity-marketing businesses and 1989 City of Seattle Small Business of the Year, which delivered $10 million to its non-profit partners in license fees. In the 1990s, she served as Executive Producer of Fabrica, Benetton‚Äôs Institute of Arts and Communication, whose purpose is to create new avenues for innovative communication.

Dealing in wildly difficult topics‚Äîincluding depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, and the adolescent Burroughs‚Äô sexual relationship with a much older man‚ÄîRunning with Scissors became an astonishing literary phenomenon. It remained at the top of The New York Times Best Sellers list for nearly three consecutive years, and was adapted into the 2006 film starring Annette Bening, Joseph Fiennes, Alec Baldwin, Jill Clayburgh, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Burroughs‚Äô follow-up memoir, Dry, which chronicled his experience as an ad executive struggling to overcome alcoholism‚Äîwhile watching his best friend and former lover succumb to AIDS‚Äîwas also a #1 New York Times bestseller.

Augusten Burroughs was born Christopher Robison, in 1965 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania‚Äîthe son of John G. Robison, the head of the philosophy department at the University of Massachusetts, and the writer Margaret Robison. He left school after the sixth grade, and moved to New York City at age 17 to pursue a career in advertising. Burroughs spent the next decade and a half in advertising, creating award-winning campaigns for brands including American Express, UPS, and Beck‚Äôs Beer. At the age of 34, he wrote his first novel, Sellevision, by working almost non-stop for seven days. The book was released in 2000, followed by Running with Scissors in 2002, Dry in 2003, the essay collections Magical Thinking and Possible Side Effects, as well as a much darker memoir, A Wolf at the Table, about Burroughs‚Äô troubled relationship with his father. Burroughs‚Äô most recent books are You Better Not Cry: Stories for Christmas and This is How: Proven Aid in Overcoming Shyness, Molestation, Fatness, Spinsterhood, Grief, Disease, Lushery, Decrepitude &amp; More, for Young and Old Alike‚Äîan anti-self-help book with a surprisingly redemptive message for the desperate.

An unscripted and electrifying speaker, Augusten Burroughs has appeared to crowds of hundreds at venues including Seattle‚Äôs Bumbershoot, and has fans around the world. He has been featured in Vanity Fair, USA Today, New York magazine, and countless other publications, and has been named twice to Entertainment Weekly‚Äôs ‚Äú25 Funniest People in America‚Äù.

An outspoken and deeply-respected legislator, noted for his keen sense of humor, Frank has played a key role in some of the most important legislation of our country‚Äôs recent history, including the repeal of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask, don‚Äôt tell.‚Äù

&nbsp;

As Chair of the House Financial Services Committee from 2007 to 2011, Frank helped craft the compromise bill to slow the tide of home mortgage foreclosures in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis, as well as the subsequent $550 billion rescue plan, and the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act‚Äîthe sweeping set of regulatory reforms named partly after Frank and signed into law in July 2010, to prevent the recurrence of the financial crisis.

&nbsp;

Frank also led the passage of the Credit Cardholders‚Äô Bill of Rights Act, a measure lauded by consumer advocates, and fought to preserve affordable rental housing, as well as to reduce military spending in favor of providing for important quality-of-life needs at home.

&nbsp;

Born Barnett Frank on March 31, 1940, in Bayonne, New Jersey to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe‚ÄîFrank‚Äôs parents were a truck stop owner and a legal secretary‚ÄîBarney Frank graduated from Harvard in 1962 and went on to pursue a Ph.D. He left before completing the degree to take a job as chief assistant to Boston Mayor Kevin White in 1968. Frank won a seat in the Massachusetts State Legislature in 1972, and though still closeted, went on to become a national leader of the LGBT rights movement, introducing the state‚Äôs first two gay rights bills in 1973.
In 1987, Frank became the first member of Congress to voluntarily come out as openly gay, and in 2012 he married his longtime partner Jim Ready, becoming the nation‚Äôs first congressman in a same-sex marriage while in office.

&nbsp;

Frank‚Äôs sixteen terms in Congress have left a legacy of civil rights and financial reform, and his abilities will be sorely missed. As noted by The Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúMr. Frank‚Äôs combative liberalism and quick wit make him a standout in a Capitol filled with politicians dependent on talking points and polls, a trait alluded to by Mr. Obama who said in a written statement that, ‚ÄòThe House of Representatives will not be the same without him.‚Äô‚Äù";s:10:"post_title";s:12:"Barney Frank";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:12:"barney-frank";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-04-29 16:56:47";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-04-29 16:56:47";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://www.macmillanspeakers.com/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=931";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:25;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"268";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"4";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2012-11-13 17:05:04";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2012-11-13 17:05:04";s:12:"post_content";s:1215:"<div id="ctl00_cphMainContent_divSpeakerDesc">

Having served as a police officer, police attorney, deputy district attorney, justice of the peace and elected district attorney in Las Vegas, he was also selected in 1982 as one of nine members of President Regan‚Äôs Task Force on Victims of Crime.Miller was selected by his peers to serve as President of the National District Attorneys Association during the term 1983-1984.¬† A recognized expert on the issue, he has spoken frequently about the need for criminal justice reforms.

&nbsp;

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Bob Miller arrived in Las Vegas with his family at age 10‚Äîlong before the city was recognizable as the place it is today. The son of a gaming pioneer‚Äîwho started out as bookmaker and business acquaintance of some very dubious criminal types and ended up a respectable businessman and a partner and eventually Chairman of the Board of the Riviera Hotel and Casino‚ÄîMiller was directed away from the glamor of Las Vegas tourism toward a more traditional upbringing and an early career in law enforcement.

&nbsp;

While studying law at Loyola Law School, Miller worked during consecutive summers as a police officer for the Los Angeles and Las Vegas Sheriff‚Äôs offices, returning after graduation to Las Vegas to help enable the launch of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. After joining the District Attorney‚Äôs Office, and later as a lower court judge, Miller became especially aware of the trauma of child abuse and the disparity between the rights of the accused with those of the victim. Mr. Miller went on to serve as Clark County‚Äôs District Attorney, and then on to the state capital as Lieutenant Governor of Nevada.

&nbsp;

Miller became Governor of Nevada in 1989. During his ten years in office, he transformed the Nevada economy by paving the way for infrastructure improvements‚Äîallowing for the construction of twenty of the largest hotels ever built; achieved a more efficient government while at the same time promoting more women to executive manager levels than any predecessor; and led the movement for Las Vegas to become the meeting capital of the world. During Miller‚Äôs term, the convention capacity of Nevada grew from just under one million to over seven million square feet‚Äîand by the time he left office in 1999, Nevada was served via non-stop air by foreign carriers from Tokyo, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Brussels, London, Manchester, Mexico City and all major cities in Canada.

&nbsp;

After leaving office, Mr. Miller specialized in business-to-public-sector relationship-building at all levels of government. He was invited by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Argentina, a post he declined for his family, and was placed by the U.S. State Department in select technical assistance consultations with the economic and finance ministries of countries including the republics of Bulgaria, Georgia and the Russian Federation. After helping persuade Clinton to be the first U.S. President to visit Bulgaria, Miller was designated Honorary Consul General for the Republic of Bulgaria.

&nbsp;

Miller is a past president of the International Association of Gaming Advisors (IAGA) and has spoken internationally, at the Russian real estate market conference in Moscow (2007), as well as at numerous tourism conferences and gaming conferences in Bulgaria. He is married with three children, the eldest of whom is Ross Miller, the current Secretary of State of Nevada. Miller holds a juris doctorate degree from Loyola Law School, and a bachelor of arts in political science from Santa Clara University, as well as several honorary degrees.";s:10:"post_title";s:10:"Bob Miller";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:10:"bob-miller";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-05-02 17:14:22";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-05-02 17:14:22";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://www.macmillanspeakers.com/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=976";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:32;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"398";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"4";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2012-11-14 03:20:34";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2012-11-14 03:20:34";s:12:"post_content";s:2976:"<div id="ctl00_cphMainContent_divSpeakerDesc">

<div>Bob Newhart has had a celebrated career in comedy, from the success of shows like ‚ÄúThe Bob Newhart Show‚Äù to his induction into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. Famous for his one-man telephone conversations, Newhart appeals to all generations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Newhart started out as the copywriter for an advertising agency, also working as an accountant on the side. He used to keep himself entertained at work by joking around with a friend‚Äîthey would make long phone calls to each other and recorded these antics as audition tapes. Although his friend eventually stopped, Newhart continued the prank phone calls by himself. This was the birth of his trademark one-man phone act.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 1959, a Chicago deejay introduced him to the head of talent at Warner Bros. Records, and he was signed onto their label immediately. His first album, ‚ÄúThe Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart,‚Äù became the first comedy album to go to the top of the charts. It won the ‚ÄúAlbum of the Year‚Äù Award at the 1961 Grammys, and Newhart was named ‚ÄúArtist of the Year.‚Äù He released seven more albums, each of them selling into the millions.</div>
<div></div>
<div>His first show was a variety show on CBS, which earned him a Peabody Award and an Emmy nomination in its first season. In 1972, CBS aired the premier of Newhart‚Äôs first sitcom series, ‚ÄúThe Bob Newhart Show,‚Äù co-starring Suzanne Pleshette. The show continued successfully for six years, featuring a large, talented cast of comics and actors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>During the success of ‚ÄúThe Bob Newhart Show,‚Äù Newhart starred in Hollywood hits such as Hell is for Heroes, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, Catch 22, Little Miss Marker, Hot Millions, Cold Turkey, Thursday‚Äôs Game, and First Family opposite big Hollywood names.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After the end of ‚ÄúThe Bob Newhart Show,‚Äù Newhart toured around the country for four years, performing live stand-up comedy onstage. In 1982, Newhart returned to CBS with ‚ÄúNewhart,‚Äù which was immensely successful for eight seasons. Newhart decided to cut the series short, opting to end the series during the peak of its success. Since then, he has been in a number of movies, such as ‚ÄúElf‚Äù (2003) and hit TV-series, such as ‚ÄúER‚Äù and ‚ÄúDesperate Housewives.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Newhart‚Äôs other achievements include his selection as Grand Marshall of the 102 Tournament of Roses Parade. ‚ÄúThe Button Down Mind of Bob Newhart‚Äù was added to the Library of Congress‚Äô 2006 National Recording Registry, and Bob Newhart was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters‚Äô Hall of Fame in 2009.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Newhart lives with his wife and four children in California. He continues to put on shows throughout the country and still occasionally stars in Hollywood movies.</div>

<div>Bob Woodward is regarded as one of America‚Äôs preeminent investigative reporters and non-fiction authors. He has worked for The Washington Post since 1971 as a reporter, and is currently an associate editor of the Post. While a young reporter for The Washington Post in 1972, Woodward was teamed up with Carl Bernstein; the two did much, but not all, of the original news reporting on the Watergate scandal that led to numerous government investigations and the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon. Gene Roberts, former managing editor of The New York Times has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein ‚Äúmaybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Woodward has authored or coauthored 15 non-fiction books in the last 35 years. All 15 have been national bestsellers and 11 of them have been #1 national non-fiction bestsellers ‚Äî more #1 national non-fiction bestsellers than any contemporary author. He has written multiple #1 national non-fiction bestsellers on a wide range of subjects in each of the four decades he has been active as an author, from 1974 to 2009.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He has been a recipient of nearly every other major American journalism award, including the Heywood Broun award (1972), Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Reporting (1972 and 1986), Sigma Delta Chi Award (1973), George Polk Award (1972), William Allen White Medal (2000), and the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Reporting on the Presidency (2002). Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard called Woodward ‚Äúthe best pure reporter of his generation, perhaps ever.‚Äù¬† In 2003, Albert Hunt of The Wall Street Journal called Woodward ‚Äúthe most celebrated journalist of our age.‚Äù In 2004, Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, ‚ÄúWoodward has established himself as the best reporter of our time.

Brigitte Gabriel has become one of the leading terrorism experts in the world providing information and analysis on Global Islamic terrorism. She is a member of the board of Advisors of the Intelligence Summit and lectures nationally and internationally about terrorism and current affairs. Her expertise are sought after by world and business leaders. She has addressed the Australian Prime Minister John Howard, members of The British Parliament/House of Commons, members of the United States Congress, The Joint Forces Staff College, The US Special Operations Command, the FBI and many others. In addition, Gabriel is a regular guest analyst on Fox News Channel, CNN, MSNBC, ABC and various radio stations daily across America.

Gabriel began her career as news anchor for "World News," an evening Arabic news broadcast for Middle East Television seen throughout Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Cyprus and Lebanon. She covered the Israeli security zone in Lebanon and the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank. Her work is of international scope having brought her in contact with world figures such as Margaret Thatcher, George H. Bush, Queen Nour El Hussein, Itzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres.

With a passion and vigor hailing directly from profound experience -- the opening salvos of Islamic jihad towards the Western world in the Middle East -- Gabriel offers a poignant account of a remarkable upbringing. A native of South Lebanon, as a pre-teen she survived the first attack of the Lebanese civil war in 1975: a barrage of Muslim rockets that exploded in her house and left her wounded and buried under the rubble. Gabriel and her family then spent the next seven years in subterranean hiding while Lebanon was under Islamic attack.

Fiercely articulate and passionately committed, Gabriel outlines mistakes the West has made in underestimating the single-mindedness with which radical Islamists have pursued their goals for the past 30 years. A political hawk on international policy, she discusses the threat of radical Islam to world peace and national security in her New York Times best-selling memoir, <em>Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terrorism Warns America.¬† </em>Gabriel's second book, <em>They Must Be Stopped </em>continues her mission to - in her words - "challenge our western and politically-correct notions about Islam, demonstrating why radical Islam is so deadly and how we can halt its progress."¬† Gabriel took up residence in Israel in 1984 and while there rose quickly to an anchor position with Middle East Television's "World News" -- an evening-news program broadcast in Israel, Lebanon, Syria and beyond. Relocating to the United States in 1989, she created a TV production and advertising company, with a client roster that included ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX News, CNN, Discovery, TLC and the History Channel.

From the war-torn bomb shelters of Lebanon to the boardrooms of America, Gabriel is a startling illustration of the American Dream. An inspiration for women throughout the world, she has balanced the demands of a successful career with the equally challenging duties of motherhood. Her passionate lectures emit a positive and empowering message to act on one's beliefs.

Chandler Burr is The New York Times' perfume critic. His new book, <em>The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York</em>, tells two parallel stories, the first about a year Burr spent for The New Yorker magazine in Paris behind the scenes at Herm√®s watching legendary perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena create the Herm√®s scent "Un Jardin sur le Nil"; and the second about a year (beginning with an article for The New York Times) inside Coty with Sarah Jessica Parker as she directed the making of her perfume "Lovely."

His first novel, <em>You Or Someone Like You</em>, will be published¬†in the summer of 2009. It was originally excerpted as a novel in progress by narrativemagazine.com

Burr is also author of the books <em>The Emperor of Scent: A True Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses</em> and <em>A Separate Creation: The Search for the Biological Origins of Sexual Orientation, </em>based on his Atlantic cover story, "Homosexuality and Biology."

He speaks around the world on scent and perfume and hosts interactive masterclasses in gourmand scents; this series explains perfume for the lay person and shows fragrance's structure and artistry, with food-based scent raw materials (absolutes of cinnamon, clove, pepper) and gourmand perfumes like "Angel" (which uses the scent of cotton candy) and "Shalimar" (the scent of vanilla) reflected in a 7-course gourmet meal.

Beginning his journalism career as a stringer at the Christian Science Monitor's Southeast Asia bureau in Manila, Burr then earned a Masters in International Economics &amp; Japan studies from the Paul H. Nitze School/Johns Hopkins. He has also studied international relations at l'Institut d'√©tudes politiques in Paris and Chinese history at Min Zu Xue Yuen (Central Institute of Foreign Nationalities) in Beijing.

Burr has written on business for Fast Company and Fortune, politics for the New York Times Magazine, on travel and food for Gourmet, Food &amp; Wine, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure, and Departures, and religion and science for US News &amp; World Report, where he was a Contributing Editor. His first stage play, "Exquisite," was nominated in 1992 for the Helen Hayes award for Outstanding New Play.

She has been involved with autism spectrum disorders for over 20 years as both a parent and a professional on both sides of the Atlantic. Recently, Chantal founded Autism College in order to provide more information and online training to parents and educators. She has given over 125 talks in 21 different states and six countries.Born into a large French family, Chantal was brought up bilingual and bicultural in Ohio, New York and California. Family pastimes included cooking frog legs for breakfast over an open fire during summers spent camping in Louisville, Kentucky. Chantal received her BA in Social Ecology from the University of California at Irvine. Her first practical experience with autism was at Fairview State Hospital, teaching self-help and community living skills to severely developmentally disabled and autistic adolescents in preparation for their deinstitutionalization. Then, as a case manager for Orange County Regional Center for the Developmentally Disabled, Chantal provided information and resources to families.Little did Chantal know that years later, these work experiences would prove invaluable when her son Jeremy, now a young adult, was born and eventually diagnosed with autism in Paris, France, where the only treatment on offer was psychoanalysis. Chantal‚Äôs struggle to find appropriate treatment for her son led them to move to England, where they became one of the first families in the UK to run a Lovaas-type (based on applied behavior analysis) home program. Having been a service provider in California, and then a parent raising her child and dealing with the ‚Äôsystems‚Äô in France, United Kingdom and the United States, gives Chantal a unique and well-rounded perspective few people in this field have.In 2009 Chantal was appointed by the¬†California Senate Select Committee on Autism &amp; Related Disorders to Co-Chair the South Counties Autism Regional Taskforce. Chantal had previously served on the Taskforce on Transitional Services &amp; Supports reporting to the California Legislative Blue Ribbon Commission on Autism.A former researcher on BBC documentaries and a line producer on a TV Series in Paris, Chantal has written five books.¬†She writes for <em>The Huffington Post</em> and PyschologyToday.com. Chantal‚Äôs fifth book, co-authored with her son Jeremy, is called A<em> Full Life with Autism: From Learning to Forming Relationships to Achieving Independence</em>, and will be published in March 2012.

He is the author of the landmark book, <i>The Other Side of Innovation: Solving the Execution Challenge</i>, with Vijay Govindarajan, as well as their <i>New York Times </i>bestselling follow-up, <i>Reverse Innovation: Create Far From Home, Win Everywhere</i>‚Äîwhich applied their research to the challenge of innovating to drive growth in emerging markets, while bringing those innovations home. A true visionary in his field, Trimble serves on the faculties of both the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and the Dartmouth Center for Health Care Delivery Science‚Äîwhere he is immersed in a multi-year effort to apply his work to the specific challenge of innovation in health care delivery.

&nbsp;

Trimble is actively enjoying the payoff of his work in its real-world application‚Äîworking shoulder-to-shoulder with innovation leaders in top corporations including General Electric, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, The New York Times Company, Genencor, Corning, Thomson Reuters, eBay, Fidelity, Unilever, and many, many others. A highly sought-after speaker, he has been welcomed by audiences at both public forums such as the <i>BusinessWeek</i> CEO Forum, the Conference Board‚Äôs Innovation Conference, and the HSM Innovation Forum‚Äîas well as for membership groups and associations such as American Public Power Association, Construction Industry Roundtable, CUSO Financial Services, Institute of Management Studies, and more.

His interdisciplinary research is accentuated in his inaugural book, <i>Beyond Cairo: US Engagement with the Muslim World.</i>

&nbsp;

As a part of Palgrave Macmillan‚Äôs Global Public Diplomacy Book Series, this book examines the U.S.‚Äôs once enthusiastic commitment to restore trusted relations with the Arab and larger Muslim world since President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2009 ‚ÄúNew Beginning‚Äù address in Cairo, Egypt.¬† This book tackles the problem with public diplomacy as the U.S. has been practicing it and provides a roadmap for the White House and State Department to re-engage the Muslim world over the coming years.

&nbsp;

As an expert in cross-cultural relations, Ezell writes widely on issues related to the Middle East and North African, human rights, ethnic conflict, and pop culture.¬† His human rights activism is featured in the John Fiege film, <i>Mississippi Chicken</i>, highlighting his advocacy for fair treatment of Latino poultry workers in rural Mississippi.

&nbsp;

Known by many as a captivating young man with an infectious gift to warm the core of any stranger, Ezell is inspired to participate in causes that build upon a legacy deriving from his family‚Äôs involvement in the Alabama Civil Rights Movement. In order to accomplish that successfully and unapologetically, he made his way to New York after 9/11 to study conflict resolution, pursuing a M.A. in Theology and Social Ethics at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University.¬† There he demonstrated his commitment to building bridges between religious and political leaders, first by working closely in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities in post-9/11 New York City with the Interfaith Center of New York and later in Chicago, IL at Interfaith Worker Justice.

&nbsp;

Garnering international attention while completing his Ph.D. in England, Ezell worked at the U.S. Department of State and the William J. Clinton Foundation (Clinton School of Public Service).

&nbsp;

He has been invited as a consultant to non-government organizations, think-tanks and universities on how best to manage global change. His sense of humor, knowledge, confidence, and passion combined make him captivating to media and live audiences alike. Ezell‚Äôs achievements in the United States and Europe have provided him a global platform as a dynamic speaker to deliver keynote addresses for international organizations, panel and workshop discussions at conferences, and lectures for academic institutions.

David Bezmozgis was born in Riga, Latvia in the former USSR.¬† He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1980.¬† In the spring of 2003 he emerged on the literary scene when three of his stories were published almost simultaneously in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Harper‚Äôs</em>, and <em>Zoetrope All-Story</em>. These stories formed the core David‚Äôs first book, the acclaimed <em>Natasha and Other Stories</em>, which chronicled the experiences of a family of Soviet Jews who immigrate to Toronto in the 1980s. ‚ÄúThese complex, evocative stories herald the arrival of a significant new voice,‚Äù declared <em>Publisher‚Äôs Weekly</em>.

&nbsp;

<em>Natasha</em> went on to be translated into more than a dozen languages and was a <em>New York Times Notable Book for 2004</em>, as well as an <em>Amazon.com Top 10 Book, </em>and among the ‚ÄúBest Books‚Äù selections of <em>The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, The Economist, Publisher‚Äôs Weekly, </em>and <em>The Independent. </em>It was also chosen by <em>The New York Public Library</em> as one of the ‚Äú25 Books to Remember for 2004.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Among its prizes, it garnered the Commonwealth First Book Prize (Canada/Carribean), The Reform Judaism Prize for Jewish Fiction, The Canadian Jewish Fiction Prize, the Jewish Quarterly Wingate Prize for Fiction (UK), and the City of Toronto Book Award. It was also shortlisted for <em>The Guardian </em>First Book Award, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> Art Seidenbaum First Book Award, and The Governor General‚Äôs Award For Fiction (Canada).

&nbsp;

David‚Äôs work has been widely anthologized and selected for inclusion in <em>The Best American Short Stories</em> in 2005 and 2006.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the summer of 2006, David was among a select number of screenwriters to be invited to the Sundance Screenwriter‚Äôs Lab. In 2009, <em>Victoria Day</em>, David‚Äôs first feature film as writer, director and producer, premiered at The Sundance Film Festival. Also set in Toronto in the 1980s, the film covered territory similar to that of <em>Natasha</em>. Since its Sundance premiere, <em>Victoria Day</em> has also played at numerous film festivals around the world, including The Shanghai International Film Festival, The Moscow International Film Festival, The Athens International Film Festival, and the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival.

<div>For almost three decades, David Fisher has been writing about an extraordinary variety of subjects, ranging from Mafia hit men to Nobel Prize winning biochemists. He is the author of more than 50 books and has been a frequent contributor to major magazines and newspapers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He began his professional career as a staff writer for comedienne Joan Rivers‚Äô syndicated talk show, "That Show." From there he joined Life Magazine, covering primarily sports and youth culture.¬† He has since written for many notable publications including The New York Times and Sports Illustrated.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He began his free-lance writing career with a children‚Äôs biography of Malcolm X. A year later he co-authored his first bestseller, <em>Killer,</em> with ‚ÄòJoey Black,‚Äô the first confessional written by a Mafia hit man.¬† He is among the most highly regarded collaborators in publishing and among the figures with whom he has worked are ‚ÄòJoey the Hitman,‚Äô Joseph ‚ÄòDonnie Brasco‚Äô Pistone and Bill Bonanno, Terry Bradshaw, Ron Luciano, George Burns, Eddie Fisher, Leslie Nielsen, Ed McMahon, Johnnie Cochran, William Shatner, and Nobel Prize winning biochemist Kary Mullis.

His novels and nonfiction works have achieved both commercial success and critical acclaim. He is a well known humorist and among his most successful books are <em>Chicken Poop for the Soul, Legally Correct Fairy Tales</em> and the award-winning <em>Conversations with my Cat</em>, which was a major European bestseller. Among his investigative works are <em>Patient #1</em>, which is in production as an HBO movie, and <em>Hard Evidence</em>, for which he became the only reporter ever granted complete access to the FBI‚Äôs famed forensic laboratory.¬† His novels include <em>The Pack</em>, which was adapted for film, and <em>The War Magician</em>, which is based on one of WWII‚Äôs most incredible stories.

Fisher‚Äôs most recent bestseller is William Shatner‚Äôs autobiography, <em>Up Till Now</em>, which was published in May 2008, as was Congressman Robert Wexler‚Äôs extremely-well reviewed book, <em>Fire-Breathing Liberal</em>, an insider‚Äôs look at the way the House of Representatives functions.</div>

<div>Fisher continues to write prolifically.¬†¬†Published in 2009 is <em>The Accountant</em>,¬† Fisher‚Äôs collaboration with Roberto Escobar, Pablo Escobar‚Äôs brother, who with his brother led the infamous Medellin drug cartel, telling the whole story of the rise and fall of the most successful criminal in history. Next is Fisher‚Äôs collaboration with former Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski, who is the central figure in baseball‚Äôs steroid scandal and provided much of the information revealed by Senator George Mitchell in the Mitchell Report. Third (but not last) is Fisher‚Äôs collaboration¬† with Detective Tommy Dades (NYPD ret.), and Brooklyn Assistant District Attorney Michael Vecchione, the two men who opened the cold case leading to the indictment and conviction of two highly placed New York City detectives who were moonlighting as Mafia killers. <em>Friends of the Family: The True Story of the Mafia Cops</em>,¬†was published in 2009. The as yet untitled movie has recently been green-lighted for production.</div>

<div>Dick Armey was a member of the House of Representatives for eighteen years, acting as the House Majority Leader from 1995 to 2003. Since 2003, he has been the chairman of FreedomWorks, a non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. that fights for less government and lower taxes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After receiving his Ph.D in economics from the University of Oklahoma, Armey began his teaching career at the University of Montana. Armey became the chairman of the economics department at the University of North Texas in 1977, exposing him to a more ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù environment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He was first elected to Congress in 1984, and quickly solidified a reputation for himself in Washington as a conservative member dedicated to good public policy. After winning re-election in 1986, he had his first legislative victory: the passage of an amendment with Congressman Jack Kemp and Delegate Walter Fauntroy to reform public housing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also during this second term, Armey passed landmark legislation that propelled him to national recognition‚Äîhe collaborated with key Democrats and fought against the Reagan Defense Department to pass legislation to close down obsolete military bases. As a result, more than 100 obsolete bases are being closed, saving taxpayers more than $4 billion a year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Wall Street Journal wrote in 1988, ‚ÄúBy tempering his tactics without abandoning his goals, [Armey] is getting legislation passed.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Armey‚Äôs next goal was to fight federal farm reforms in 1990. Along with other conservative Republicans, he teamed up with urban liberals like Charles Schumer and Barney Frank to form a bipartisan coalition, pressuring agricultural committees to bring forward leaner bills. Their efforts laid the groundwork for the free market reforms in the 1996 Freedom to Farm legislation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In January 1991, Armey was appointed ranking Republican on the Joint Economic Committee after leading the opposition to President Bush‚Äôs tax increases. He decided to run for Conference Chairman in June of 1992, and was elected in December of the same year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 1994, he was the main author of the republican Contract with America‚Äîa list of ten bills that Republicans would bring up for vote during the first 100 days of a Republican-controlled Congress. The Contract was a success, and the Republicans controlled the House for the first time in 40 years. Armey became the Majority Leader of the 104th Congress.</div>
<div></div>

Ed Gray is the co-author of <em>In Nixon‚Äôs Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate</em>, his father L. Patrick Gray‚Äôs memoir of his year as acting director of the FBI immediately following the death of J. Edgar Hoover. Following his father‚Äôs death in 2005, Gray began looking into his father‚Äôs belief that the names - and especially the motives - of the actual anonymous sources of press leaks during that time had never been honestly identified. In presentations that have included Dartmouth College and the Nixon Presidential Library, Gray has led audiences through that quest for the truth, allowing them arrive at their own conclusions and speculations.

Gray, who at the time of Watergate was a junior naval officer in a highly classified job similar to the one held by Bob Woodward, met many of the players then. Others he came to know much later. In between, he founded, with his wife Rebecca, the esteemed <em>Gray‚Äôs Sporting Journal</em> and went on to his prolific career as a book author and magazine journalist.

ERIC VOLZ is a native of Northern California. He holds a degree in Latin American Studies from the University of California, San Diego. Other university level studies include coursework at the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara, Mexico, and upper division coursework at Ponifica Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra, Dominican Republic.

In 2004, Eric moved to Nicaragua and launched EP Magazine, a successful, full-color, bi-lingual publication focusing on conscious living, cross-cultural understanding and sustainable development. His work with this project continued until November 2006 when he was falsely accused and wrongfully convicted for the rape and murder of his ex-girlfriend Doris Jim√©nez, and consequently sentenced to a 30-year prison term.

After spending over a year in the Nicaraguan Prison system, an appeals court overturned the conviction and Volz was released in December of 2007.

Since his release, Volz filed a petition in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States, seeking a declaration of his innocence and protection under the American Convention on Human Rights from further persecution by the Government of Nicaragua. Although he is no longer behind bars, his case continues to test the role and authority of a supra-national tribunal with major potential to engage international policy discussions and subsequent reform.

<div>Erin Brockovich grew up in Lawrence, Kansas, the youngest child of an industrial engineer and a journalist. After graduating from Lawrence High School, she attended Kansas State University for one year, then moved to Dallas, Texas, where she earned her Associate in Applied Arts degree at Wades Business College.</div>
<div>After college, Erin moved to Southern California where she worked for K-Mart as a management trainee before taking a job at Fluor Engineers and Constructors to work and study to become an electrical design engineer. It was at this time when Erin decided to explore the world of beauty pageants. Although she won the title of Miss Pacific Coast, she quit after a year and married a restaurant manager.</div>
<div>She moved back to Kansas where her two older children, Matthew and Katie, were born. In 1987, the family settled in Reno, Nevada, before she divorced her first husband. As a mother of two children and newly single, she got a job as a secretary at a local brokerage, where she met a stockbroker. They married in 1989 and Erin gave birth to her youngest daughter, Elizabeth. In 1990, her marriage ended in divorce. She was again a single mother, this time with three children to feed and clothe.</div>
<div>After being seriously injured in a traffic accident in Reno, Erin and her kids moved back to Southern California where she hired Jim Vititoe of Masry &amp; Vititoe to handle her auto accident case in 1991. Not long after her case was resolved, she was hired to work at the law firm as a file clerk. While organizing papers in a pro bono real estate case, she found medical records in the file that caught her eye. After getting permission from one of the firm's principals, Ed Masry, she began to research the matter.</div>
<div>Her investigation eventually established that the health of countless people who lived in and around Hinkley, California, in the 1960's, 70's and 80's had been severely compromised by exposure to toxic Chromium 6. The Chromium 6 had leaked into the groundwater from the nearby Pacific Gas and Electric Company's Compressor Station. In 1996, as a result of the largest direct action lawsuit of its kind, spearheaded by Erin and Ed Masry, the giant utility paid the largest toxic tort injury settlement in U.S. history: $333 million in damages to more than 600 Hinkley residents.</div>
<div>Her investigation inspired the hit movie "Erin Brockovich", which highlighted my legal triumph and personal challenges. Released in March 2000 by Universal Studios, it starred Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich. The movie's great success led to numerous awards and nominations, including 5 Academy Award nominations and one win. Steven Soderbergh was nominated for an Oscar for ‚ÄúBest Director,‚Äù and Julia Roberts won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award for ‚ÄúBest Actress‚Äù for her portrayal of Erin.</div>
<div>From the exposure of the movie, Erin became a reluctant public figure. Over time, she realized she could use her notoriety to spread positive messages of personal empowerment and for her to encourage people to stand up and make a difference. This led to her first television project, an ABC special entitled ‚ÄúChallenge America with Erin Brockovich." It taped in New York and aired in December 2001. This feel good program is best described as "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" on steroids, but preceded that successful series. She set out to motivate and organize hundreds of volunteers and donated resources to help rebuild a dilapidated park in downtown Manhattan a few months following 9/11.</div>
<div>Erin then hosted the Lifetime series "Final Justice." This series recreated incredible stories of actual women, their perilous situations and how they overcame adversity. She followed that up with her book entitled, <em>Take It from Me, Life's a Struggle, But You Can Win.</em></div>
<div><em>
</em>As President of the consulting firm Brockovich Research &amp; Consulting, Erin is involved in numerous major environmental cases.</div>
<div>She has come a long way from file clerk to inspired environmental activist to motivational speaker to television host and producer.</div>
<div>Erin remarried in 1999 to Eric Ellis, and lives with her husband and children in Southern California.</div>

Born and raised in North Tonawanda, New York (eight miles up the river from Niagara Falls), Gary Ecelbarger grew up with a fascination for history and science and a burning desire to write. He received an M.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Nutritional Biochemistry in 1989 and spent the next 16 years working in hospital intensive care units, teaching medical students, and conducting clinical research.

But beginning in the 1990's Ecelbarger also combined his love of history and writing. After publishing magazine articles and book reviews, he wrote his first book, <em>We Are in for It!</em>, which was published in 1997 and featured as an editor's choice for the History Book Club. That same year, Time-Life Books hired Ecelbarger as a consultant and writer for two volumes of its <em>Voices of the Civil War</em> series. By this time he was already a popular symposium speaker and a tour guide for various organizations.

Eight years, two more books and a dozen articles later, Ecelbarger quit his day job at the end of 2005 to dedicate his complete attention to writing, researching, touring, and interpreting American history. The decision immediately converted him to a prolific and popular writer of 19th century nonfiction. He is a leading authority of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley and has been consulted frequently for historical interpretations of Civil War battlefields in the Valley. He has also emerged as a Lincoln scholar and has divided his spare research and touring time in the Rockies and on Revolutionary War sites.

Since 1992 Gary Ecelbarger has resided in Virginia. He currently lives 15 miles west of Washington, D.C., with his wife, a Georgetown professor, and three school-aged children.

<div>Gary has been uncovering Wall Street wrongdoing for nearly two decades.</div>
He has spoken before a variety of academic, corporate and public-affairs audiences, ranging from the North American Securities Administrators Association to Ogilvy &amp; Mather.¬†Gary¬†will tailor his presentation for each specific audience, and speak on a wide variety of subjects -- ranging from investment fraud to the perils of poor media relations.

His forthcoming book, AYN RAND NATION, opens up a galaxy of subjects that are ripe for exploration: from the influence of Rand on the right to the absence of debate over morality in the national dialogue.

Gary can also talk about how to deal when the press when it comes a-knocking at your door.

The groups that have heard Gary speak may surprise you. One of his most recent speaking engagements was before regulatory and market regulation attorneys of the New York Stock Exchange.

One of the best-kept secrets in U.S. history, SEALs were cloaked in obscurity with a top secret clearance. Any mention of SEAL Team was in faint whispers: not only was the nation unaware of them, so was 90 percent of the Navy. SEALs worked closely with the CIA deep behind enemy lines with little or no support‚Äîif a SEAL was captured, the U.S. government disavowed their existence. Book now to hear more: Black Book Ops, Ghost Photos . . .

Gene Wentz was born in Texas and raised in Southern California where, as a high schooler, he came across a <em>Reader‚Äôs Digest</em> article about the then little-known U.S. Navy SEALs. Wentz was 18, the draft was in force and he knew his number would soon be up. He volunteered for military duty with the Navy and reported to six months of intense and grueling Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL (BUD/S) training right out of boot camp, becoming a member of SEAL Team One. After two tours to Vietnam, Wentz wrote the novel <em>Men In Green Faces</em> ‚Äúto bring honor and pride to all those who served and died‚Äù there. The book became the inspiration for a generation of SEALs, including Mark Owen, who cited <em>Men In Green Faces</em> as having put him on the path that eventually brought him face-to-face with Osama bin Laden.

Wentz was a member of Navy Special Warfare (SEAL Team) from 1968 to 1978. In the years spent with SEAL Team One in Coronado, CA; where the extreme degree of training never ended, Gene made two tours to Vietnam, became a Military Advisor, and was awarded the Silver and Bronze Star for valor and heroic achievements, along with Presidential Unit and Navy Unit citations and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. During his last years at SEAL Team, Wentz took the opportunity to teach from his experience as a combat veteran by becoming a BUD/S instructor to new trainees.

When he decided to write a book based on some of his experiences in Vietnam, Wentz embarked on a journey that would take him through reliving the atrocities of war and remembering the men in green faces who fought and died there. <em>Men In Green Faces</em> was published in 1992 by St. Martin‚Äôs Press, and has since become a classic, used in both college psychology courses and Vietnam Studies.

Wentz has traveled the U.S for TV and radio interviews, as well as to deliver lectures for service organizations, writers‚Äô conferences, high schools, and many others. In talking with the future leaders of our nation at a myriad of educational institutes in Ohio and West Virginia, Wentz speaks not only about his book and experiences as a Navy SEAL, but also about how important it is to honor those that have fought and made sacrifices for the rights and freedom we enjoy as a nation. He speaks about his own struggles in school and the hard work and never-give-up attitude it took to accomplish the things he did. Wentz coached varsity high school football among other sports to underclassmen and women.";s:10:"post_title";s:10:"Gene Wentz";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:10:"gene-wentz";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-05-02 16:04:23";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-05-02 16:04:23";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://localhost/macmillian_site/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=579";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:97;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"582";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"4";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2012-12-18 17:47:52";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2012-12-18 17:47:52";s:12:"post_content";s:1977:"<div id="ctl00_cphMainContent_divSpeakerDesc">

Actor Gene Wilder is probably best remembered for his portrayal of Willy Wonka in the 1971 adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel, ‚ÄúWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.‚Äù Born in Wisconsin, Gene studied drama at the University of Iowa before attending the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He made his Hollywood debut in 1967 with a small appearance in ‚ÄúBonnie and Clyde,‚Äù but his big break came when he starred in Mel Brook‚Äôs 1968 comedy, ‚ÄúThe Producers.‚Äù

Perhaps Gene‚Äôs best performances are in 1973‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlazing Saddles‚Äù and 1974‚Äôs ‚ÄúYoung Frankenstein,‚Äù both of which he collaborated on with director Mel Brooks. He also teamed up with actor Richard Pryor on multiple occasions, leading to a stint of comedies starring the pair, including the highly successful cult comedy, ‚ÄúStir Crazy.‚Äù

Gene wrote and directed multiple films, including 1977‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Greatest Lover‚Äù and 1979‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Frisco Kid.‚Äù He met his late wife, Gilda Radner, on the set of the 1982 movie, ‚ÄúHanky Panky.‚Äù They were married for five years until Gilda‚Äôs death in 1989 from ovarian cancer. After her death, Gene co-founded Gilda‚Äôs Club, a support group for victims of ovarian cancer, and supported the creation of the Gilda Radner Ovarian Cancer Detection Center in Los Angeles, CA.

In 1998, he collaborated on the book, <em>Gilda‚Äôs Disease</em>, with oncologist Steve Piver, furthering his dedication to the fight against ovarian cancer. He released his autobiography, <em>Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art, </em>in 2006 to much critical praise. He has recently published two novels, <em>The French Whore </em>(St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2007) and <em>The Woman Who Wouldn‚Äôt </em>(St. Martin‚Äôs Griffin, 2009). Gene currently lives in Connecticut with his wife, Karen Boyer, and remains active in his charity work for ovarian cancer.

In 1985, his parents received a visa for America through a lottery-based system in India, and the following year, when he was four, the family settled in San Jose, California. His parents had arrived with only $25 to their name, and they struggled at menial jobs to make a future for their four children.

For the Chahal family, as for many immigrants, education was paramount, but G left high school at sixteen to form Click Agents, an Internet advertising company, which he sold two years later for $40 million. In January 2004, he launched a second company, BlueLithium - the next generation in Internet advertising. The company was focused on data, optimization, and analytics and became a pioneer of behavioral targeting. BlueLithium was named one of the top 100 private companies in America three years in a row by AlwaysOn, and in 2006, it received highest honor as Top Innovator of the Year.

<div>
<div>Winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize for Fiction, Herta M√ºller is a highly prolific novelist and essayist whose works portray the human destruction of the Romanian dictatorship and the rootlessness of the political exile.</div>
<div></div>
<div>She was born in August 1953 in the German-speaking village of Nitzkydorf, in the Banat district of Romania. She left her village to study German and Romanian literature at the University of Timisoara. Here she became part of the Aktionsgruppe Banat, a group of idealistic Romanian-German writers seeking freedom of expression under the Ceaucescu dictatorship. After completing her studies she was employed as a translator in a machine factory, until she was fired for refusing to cooperate with the secret police. During this time she wrote the short stories that make up the collection Niederungen, but she had difficulty satisfying the censors, and this work was not published until 1982, and then in radically modified form. Niederungen was followed two years later by Dr√ºckender Tango.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In these two works M√ºller depicted the hypocrisy of village life and its ruthless oppression of nonconformists. She portrayed the zealously fascist mentality of the German minority, its intolerance and corruption. Not surprisingly, she was sharply criticized at home for destroying the idyllic image of German rural life in Romania.
M√ºller was working as a teacher when her uncensored manuscript of Niederungen was smuggled to the west and published by the Rotbuch Verlag to instant critical acclaim. After a trip to the Frankfurt book fair, where she spoke out publicly against the Romanian dictatorship, she was forbidden to publish in Romania. She continued to write, however, even as her situation in Romania became more and more intolerable. In 1987 she emigrated to the West with her husband, Richard Wagner. Since then, she has been living in Berlin.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Many of M√ºller's works reflect aspects of her own history. Der Mensch ist ein gro√üer Fasan auf der Welt (1986) chronicles the efforts of a Romanian-German peasant family to get passports to leave the country. Like her earlier works, this tale exposes the brutal corruption of the village by showing how its officials, from postmaster to priest, demanded ever more material and sexual favors from those petitioning to leave the country. It, like the collection Barf√º√üiger Februar (1987), was written while M√ºller was waiting for permission to emigrate to the west.</div>
<div>Reisende auf einem Bein (1989) portrays the problems of resettlement in the west, and the feelings of alienation that plague the political exile. Many of the essays in Eine warme Kartoffel ist ein warmes Bett (1992) are reflections on political events, written from the perspective of a woman reluctant to lay claim to words such as "homeland." A second volume of essays, Der Teufel sitzt im Spiegel (1991) includes a series of lectures on "Gedanken zum Schreiben" that M√ºller held at the University of Paderborn in 1989-1990. It is an indispensable key to understanding the tensions and conflicts that give rise to the poetic imagery in her work. The volume includes a number of collages combining image and text. M√ºller published a complete set of 94 collages under the title Der W√§chter nimmt seinen Kamm. Vom Weggehen und Ausscheren in 1993; although poetic images are densely concentrated here onto single, unbound pages, they form an evolving network of motifs that give unity to the whole.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The novel Der Fuchs war damals schon der J√§ger (1992) is a complete reworking of a filmscript entitled "Der Fuchs der J√§ger," that she co-wrote with Harry Merkle. The main character is a teacher harassed by the Romanian secret police. Through synecdoche M√ºller portrays the fragmentation of self that occurs in a nation governed by fear. M√ºller's latest novel Herztier (1994) is her richest portrayal to date of life in the Romanian dictatorship, in that she links the repressive childhood of her narrator with the brutal oppression of the state. Her most recent work, Hunger und Seide (1995), is a collection of essays, many of them reflections on her situation as nonconformist and dissident in Nitzkydorf and Timisoara.</div>
<div></div>
<div>M√ºller's works are characterized by pure, poetic language and metonymic metaphors that recur and evolve throughout her tales. The oppressiveness of theme is alleviated by the beauty of her prose and the flashes of humor behind some of her imagery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Through words and actions M√ºller continues to demonstrate her independence from the dogma of church and state. She has been an outspoken critic of those East German writers who collaborated with the secret police, and has recently withdrawn from P.E.N. as a protest against its decision to merge with its former DDR branch. She has won a dozen literary prizes, including the Marieluise-Flei√üer Prize (1990), the Kranichsteiner Literary Prize (1991), the Kleist Prize (1994), and the European Literary Prize "Aristeion" (1995).</div>

Jeffrey Robinson is the international best-selling author of more than two dozen books, both fiction and non-fiction.¬† His newest book, <em>The Takedown, </em>is his fifth investigative true crime expos√© centered on a real-life Law &amp; Order case.¬† Mr. Robinson has avidly maintained a reputation for the past 15 years as a prominent expert on organized crime and upheld the title given by the British Bankers' Association as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most important financial crime author.‚Äù

In his ground-breaking non-fiction, <em>The Laundrymen</em>, he uncovers the true extent of global money laundering and reveals how billions of dirty dollars‚Äîacquired largely from the drug trade‚Äîare reinvested throughout the world by otherwise legitimate businessmen, lawyers, and bankers.¬† This work, still considered the definitive book on the subject and used in universities and law schools as a text, established him as a known expert on fraud and money laundering.¬† Among his array of significant titles, he also wrote three major best-selling biographies including <em>Rainier &amp; Grace</em>, <em>Bardot- Two Lives</em>, and <em>Yamani- The Inside Story</em>‚Äîdescribed by the Wall Street Journal as the best book written on the oil industry.¬† Aside from his successful track as an author, Robinson has a wide-ranging history in the media as a writer for television and radio as well as a journalist and short story writer, before and during his position as an officer in the United States Air Force.¬† He lives in New York with his family and commutes to London on a monthly basis.

After successfully launching <em>World Pulse Magazine</em> in 2004, Larsen turned her eyes to the future of communications technology in the developing world.¬†She pioneered an interactive global women‚Äôs newswire on WorldPulse.com where women worldwide‚Äîincluding those using internet cafes and cell phones from rural villages and conflict zones‚Äîcan speak for themselves to the world and solve global problems.

Most recently, Larsen has launched a new program that is training women in Web 2.0 citizen journalism and empowerment, and fostering a network of women citizen journalists from some of the most forgotten regions of the world.

Today 40,000 women in over 185 countries are connecting through World Pulse and producing a multiplier effect of change. Women previously unknown by the global public are having their stories picked up from World Pulse by the BBC, PBS, the Canadian Broadcast Corporation, the UN, and the Huffington Post and beyond.¬†In addition, by networking through World Pulse‚Äôs website, grassroots women leaders are finding job opportunities, starting new programs and businesses, launching women‚Äôs cybercaf√©s, and finding international speaking opportunities that are changing their lives and lifting their communities.

With her finger on the pulse of women‚Äôs voices globally, Jensine is increasingly sought after for inspirational keynotes, current affairs lectures and radio programs and has appeared on NPR and PBS and presented keynotes and panels at TED, Skoll World Forum for Social Entrepreneurship, Bioneers, Digital Earth, WebVisions, Women in Technology International, the Women‚Äôs Funding Network, and the Conference on World Affairs, to name a few.

Jensine has been recognized with several leadership awards including being honored as a contemporary woman spiritual leader by the Auburn Seminary with a "Lives of Commitment Award" following in the footsteps of Alice Walker and Jane Goodall.¬†In addition, she was selected as a "Woman Who Inspires" by Donna Karan alongside such luminaries as Susan Sarandon, Fatima Bhutto, and Uma Thurman.¬†Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has selected Jensine as one of six "Next Generation Changemakers" under 40 in 2011.

Holding a degree in Comparative International Studies from the University of Wisconsin Madison (1999), Larsen is also a Young Leaders Fellow with the National Committee on United States-China Relations. She was appointed to Portland, Oregon‚Äôs Vision Committee, which was established by Mayor Tom Potter to chart the city‚Äôs 30-year vision by listening to the visions of its citizens. She serves on the Advisory Board for the Nobel Women's International Campaign to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, Women Have Wings, and Ripples to Waves: A Stanford University program on Social Entrepreneurship and Development.";s:10:"post_title";s:14:"Jensine Larsen";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:14:"jensine-larsen";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-06-24 10:07:23";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-06-24 14:07:23";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://localhost/macmillian_site/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=341";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:121;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"209";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"4";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2012-11-13 15:11:04";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2012-11-13 15:11:04";s:12:"post_content";s:890:"Jerry Dennis has earned his living as a freelance writer for more than 25 years.

Jim Schlagheck is an investment advisor to the mega-wealthy, the author of <em>Cash-Rich Retirement</em>, and the co-producer of Retirement Revolution<em>,</em> the public television series on better retirement preparedness.¬†He has held top-level positions with some of the world‚Äôs leading financial institutions in the U.S., Switzerland, and the Middle East.¬†His talks, delivered with enthusiasm, insightful visuals and good humor,¬†are top-rated by audiences of yet-to-retire Americans, retirees, as well as financial-service professionals.

Jim foresees even more financial turbulence ahead. Pension underfunding, Boomer demographics, gross public and private-sector indebtedness and disregard for risk, as well as America‚Äôs ‚Äúflip‚Äù investment psychology are likely to cause more distress.¬†¬† Jim‚Äôs presentations describe ways to protect and enlarge your savings despite these challenges using the country‚Äôs most needed but often misunderstood financial products and tactics:¬† annuities, mutual funds, fundamental indexes, insurance, and a sure-fire income fixation.

Whether you are already retired, many years away from retirement, or a financial ‚Äúpro‚Äù, Jim‚Äôs tips will help you. His talks show how you can repair the investment damage that has already been done and avoid the damage that is coming.

Jim‚Äôs public speaking dovetails with the release of his book <em>Cash-Rich Retirement</em> in paperback and the airing of <em>Retirement Revolution</em>, the series he co-produced with public television which is being viewed by an estimated 23 million adult Americans nationwide.

Rabbi Deborah Zecher has said about Dr. Hoffman: "We are people that love to talk but when Joel Hoffman comes to teach, we want to listen! Of all the wonderful teachers who have spent time with our congregation, Dr. Hoffman is one of our great favorites. Throughout his weekend as scholar-in-residence, our numbers grew with each succeeding lecture as excited adult learners inspired others to join them. An erudite, witty, engaging and compassionate teacher, Joel Hoffman makes a believer out of anyone who wondered whether learning about the Hebrew language could be fun and engaging."

<div>John Keahey has spent more than thirty years as a newspaper/wire service reporter and editor who has turned his love for Italy into a career of writing and speaking on the subject.¬† His third book--<em>Seeking Sicily: A Cultural Journey through Myth and Reality</em>-- takes a unique approach beyond the typical travel narrative. It explores Sicilian culture through a variety of elements: its cuisine, which draws from the influences from the various nations that once controlled the island; its authors who, like their fellow islanders, consider themselves Sicilian rather than Italian; and through their deeply ingrained isolationist attitudes of Sicily‚Äôs three thousand-year history of being ruled by one invader after another (northern Italians being that latest conqueror during Italian Unification in 1861). Keahey also examines the influence of the Mafia and the impact of Sicilian-Greek myths that still permeate the Mediterranean's largest, most mysterious, and most historically significant island.</div>
<div>

&nbsp;

</div>
<div>His first book is a travel narrative of little known ‚Äì at least to U.S. travelers ‚Äì Southern Italy: A Sweet and Glorious Land ‚Äì Revisiting the Ionian Sea. This book follows the journey, one hundred years earlier, of Victorian novelist George Gissing through the wild and untamed reaches of the Italian peninsula‚Äôs bottom third. Gissing and Keahey explored the remains of the ancient Greek cities that once flourished in what is today Italy‚Äôs far south ‚Äì it once was called Magna Graecia, or Greater Greece ‚Äì and marveled at a land that stoically weathered invader after invader. The Greeks, here centuries before the Romans crawled out of their wooden-and-mud huts and marched down the slopes of the Palatine Hill to found a great western empire, created a civilization that still can be found in Southern Italian traditions, dialects, and DNA.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Keahey‚Äôs second book details the decades-long struggle to find a way to protect Venice from an unstoppable sea-level rise that threatens the very fabric of the city: Venice Against the Sea ‚Äì A City Besieged. The book, as the end of the twenty-first century‚Äôs first decade approaches and the relentless effects of global warming threatens coastal cities worldwide, remains the definitive study of Venice‚Äôs watery struggle through history. It describes how, and why, the city was built in the midst of an Adriatic lagoon, how Venetians for centuries stayed above the sea‚Äôs twice-daily high tides, and it dissects the controversial and mightily opposed construction of the multibillion-dollar mobile gates at the Venetian Lagoon‚Äôs entrances.</div>

<div>He speaks at colleges, community events, and a host of other organizations about his work.</div>

Over the past decade, his books have been contenders for the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, American Book Award, and more. His award-winning novels include¬†<em>The Great Death</em>,¬†<em>Edge of Nowhere, Lone Wolves,¬†</em>and¬†<em>The Trap</em>, all of which are published worldwide. The poems in¬†<em>The Binghamton Poems¬†</em>were personally selected and edited by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and American literary icon, John Updike. The late Allen Ginsberg called him "one of the best younger poets in America," and Carl Sagan wrote, "Smelcer is the voice of nations and all people." Tony Hillerman also called him "a talented and unforgettable storyteller."

&nbsp;

One of the few people who can speak, read, and write in two endangered Native American and Alaskan Native languages, Smelcer is the editor-compiler of the Ahtna Noun Dictionary (1998, 2011 revised) and The Alutiiq Noun Dictionary ¬†(2009, 2011), both archived by Oxford University and the Alaska State Historical Library. Tribes across the nation invite Smelcer to their reservations to speak about language and cultural preservation. In 1998, Smelcer was nominated for the Alaska Governor's Award for the Humanities. His bilingual poetry collection,¬†<em>The Complete Ahtna Poems</em>, includes a foreword by Noam Chomsky, the world's foremost linguist and one of the century's greatest intellectuals.

&nbsp;

Smelcer's education includes postdoctoral studies in English Literature at Cambridge and Oxford, as well as in world religions at Harvard University. He has taught at colleges and universities around the world, and for almost twenty years, has been the poetry editor and associate publisher at¬†<em>Rosebud</em>, one of America's premier magazines for contemporary writing. Here he has edited and published many of the world's greatest writers and pop icons, such as Norman Mailer, Elie Wiesel, Saul Bellow, Studs Terkel, Philip K. Dick, Allen Ginsburg, Alice Walker, Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, Ursula K. Le Guin, John Updike, and others.

&nbsp;

A man wearing many hats, Smelcer has also been an archaeologist, linguist, grants administrator, university chair, vocational college dean, and even a hospital administrator at the Alaska Native Medical Center, one of the most successful customer-based¬†indigenous hospitals in the world.

<div>John U. Bacon has worked the better part of two decades as a writer, a public speaker, a radio and TV commentator, and a college teacher.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacon earned an honors degree in history (‚Äúpre-unemployment‚Äù) from the University of Michigan, and a Master‚Äôs in Education.¬† He also was awarded a Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellowship in 2005-06, where he was the first recipient of the Benny Friedman Fellowship for Sports Journalism.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He started his journalism career covering high school sports for The Ann Arbor News, then wrote a light-hearted lifestyle column before becoming the Sunday sports feature writer for The Detroit News in 1995.¬† There he wrote long features about Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier, bullfighting in Spain, and high school basketball on a Potawatomi reservation in Michigan‚Äôs Upper Peninsula, earning numerous state and national awards for his work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After Bacon covered the 1998 Nagano Olympics, he moved from the sports page to the front page, roaming the Great Lakes State finding fresh features, such as the creation of the Mackinac Bridge, as unlikely a story as it is inspiring, and the defining effect the famous ‚ÄúAnatomy of a Murder‚Äù epic has had on its birthplace.</div>
<div>Bacon left the paper in 1999 to free-lance for some two dozen national publications.¬† These have included feature stories on Formula One racing in Australia for The New York Times, on Japanese hockey for ESPN Magazine, and on Hemingway‚Äôs Michigan summer home for Time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He has authored or coauthored five books on sports and business, including <em>A Legacy of Champions: The Story of the Men Who Built University of Michigan Football</em> (1996), <em>Blue Ice: The Story of Michigan Hockey </em>(UM Press, 2001), <em>Walgreens: America‚Äôs Corner Store</em> (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004), and <em>Cirque du Soleil: The Spark</em> (Doubleday, 2005).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacon coauthored his most recent book with the late Bo Schembechler. <em>Bo‚Äôs Lasting Lessons: The Legendary Coach Teaches the Timeless Fundamentals of Leadership</em>, has made it to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Business Best Seller list, and has received very positive reviews from Newsweek, The Washington Post, business best seller Tom Peters, and Warren Buffett, who described it as, ‚Äúa great book about a great man.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a complement to his writing, Bacon has been delivering speeches to corporations, university and service groups since 1991.¬† He speaks on the themes in his books, including developing leaders, generating creativity and instilling discipline and teamwork.¬† He has spoken from Toledo to Taipei, and Vancouver to Sao Palo for such clients as Chrysler, Ford, Microsoft Brazil, the American Museum Association and the Memphis Grizzlies.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacon has found time to pursue his passions for radio, coaching and teaching.¬† After being asked to fill in for local legend Ted Heusel on WAAM-1600 AM in Ann Arbor from 2000 to 2001, Bacon launched his own show, ‚ÄúOff the Field,‚Äù on WTKA-1050 AM.¬† It has run on Sunday mornings, from 10-12, since 2002, making it the longest running show on the station.¬† In the fall of 2007, Michigan Public Radio asked him to deliver sports commentary every Friday morning for its 500,000 listeners statewide.¬† The station is looking to expand Bacon‚Äôs work in the coming months.</div>
<div>Bacon has also provided commentary on documentary films for Michigan Public Television (‚ÄúMichigan Football Memories,‚Äù 2004), HBO Sports (‚ÄúThe Rivalry: Michigan vs. Ohio State,‚Äù 2007), and A&amp;E Biography (‚ÄúBo Schembechler,‚Äù 2009).¬† Since the fall of 2007, he has been creating stories and conducting interviews for Fox Sports Detroit and The Big Ten Network.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacon has designed three courses at the University of Michigan and Miami (Ohio) on the history of college athletics, the rise and fall of the American Sportswriter, and the art and craft of sports writing. His classes have been among the highest rated at both Miami University and the University of Michigan. In 2009, the students named him the winner of the Golden Apple Award for teaching, for which he gave the "Last Lecture."</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the side, Bacon became the head coach of his former high school hockey team, Ann Arbor Huron. As a player in the early 80s, he set the record for most games in a Huron uniform without scoring a goal, 86 (he‚Äôs not braggin‚Äô ‚Äì he‚Äôs just sayin‚Äô).¬† As a coach, he took over the worst team in school history (0-23-3 in 1999-2000), and helped transform them into the best (17-4-5, #4 in the state, and #53 in the nation), in just three seasons. In 2007, he was inducted into the Huron High School Hall of Fame.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacon is now an average hockey player, a mediocre Spanish speaker, and a poor piano player ‚Äì but this has not stopped him from enjoying all three.</div>

Roberts</i>; <i>Admiral ‚ÄúBull‚Äù Halsey</i>; and <i>Eisenhower</i>. A contributor to over 25 military journals and magazines, Wukovits has also served as an on-air commentator and historical consultant for The History Channel‚Äôs ten-part series, <i>Pacific: The Lost Evidence</i>, and as chief historian for Fox News Channel‚Äôs <i>War Stories with Oliver North</i>, in an episode about the Battle for Wake Island. He has interviewed close to 400 veterans of both theaters of World War II.

&nbsp;

Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, Wukovits moved to Michigan when his father was transferred with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. He became hooked on the Pacific Theater of World War II in grade school, after reading a book about the Battle of the Coral Sea, and began a 30-year career as a junior high school History and Language Arts teacher in 1968, upon earning a bachelor‚Äôs degree in history from the University of Notre Dame and his master‚Äôs in American History from Michigan State University. Although Wukovits had always enjoyed writing, he did not seriously look into it until the early 1980s. By then he had read so many magazine articles that Wukovits thought he could do at least as good as, if not better than, the stories he read.¬† When he finally called the editor of one and told her so, she asked him to prove it with a three-page assignment on General Henry ‚ÄúHap‚Äù Arnold. She liked what he did, and Wukovits won his first contract with <i>American History Illustrated.</i>

&nbsp;

Jonathan Rabb is best known for his Berlin Trilogy (<em>Rosa</em>, <em>Shadow and Light</em>, and <em>The Second Son</em>) the critically acclaimed series of historical thrillers set in Berlin and Barcelona between the World Wars, from 1919 to 1937. In 2006, Rabb won the international Dashiell Hammett prize at the Spanish Semana Negra Festival for <em>Rosa</em>, the first novel of his trilogy, about the mystery surrounding the murder of Socialist leader Rosa Luxemburg. ¬†He is also the author of <em>The Overseer</em> and <em>The Book of Q</em>.

The son and grandson of historians on both sides‚Äîhis father is Princeton University professor of Renaissance and Reformation history, Theodore K. Rabb‚ÄîJonathan Rabb was initially convinced that his future would lie in academia. In 1992, Rabb was in Germany as a Fulbright scholar, researching 17th-century theorist Samuel von Pufendorf, when he was inspired to write a thriller about a young professor who becomes entangled in the conspiracy surrounding a centuries-old manuscript‚Äîan even more extreme response to Machiavelli‚Äôs <em>The Prince‚Äî</em>that has been adopted by a modern-day right-wing terrorist group. Abandoning academia to concentrate on writing, Rabb had his first novel, <em>The Overseer</em>, published in 1998.

Jonathan Rabb has taught creative writing at New York University and the 92nd Street Y, and was a performer and former board member of the Blue Hill Troupe, a New York Gilbert and Sullivan company. He has also contributed essays, articles and reviews to <em>Opera News</em>, <em>American Biography</em> and the collection <em>I Wish I‚Äôd Been There.</em> Rabb graduated <em>cum laude </em>from Yale University and received a Masters degree in political theory from Columbia University. After many years of life in New York City, Rabb and his wife, a casting director, now live in Savannah, Georgia with their twin children.

&nbsp;

Kapacziewski spent seven months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and endured more than 40 surgeries, but when the leg would not heal as hoped, he chose to have it amputated with the goal of returning to service. He spent six months in physical therapy, learning to walk with a prosthetic, and re-qualified on Ranger physical standards by passing the Army Physical Fitness test: a 5-mile run in under 40 minutes, a 12-mile road march in less than 3 hours, fast rope out of a helicopter, and parachute with a combat load. SFC Kapacziewski was not only the first Ranger to return to the line with a prosthetic, he regained his squad leader position, was promoted to a platoon sergeant position, and has deployed to Afghanistan five times with the artificial limb. On May 24, 2011, he became the first enlisted soldier ever to receive the No Greater Sacrifice Freedom Award, given to individuals who epitomize selfless service to the nation.

&nbsp;

SFC Kapacziewski has deployed 10 times in total in support of the Global War on Terrorism, and his awards and decorations include: Bronze Star Medal with ‚ÄúV‚Äù device and (2 Oak Leaf Clusters), Meritorious Service Medal, Purple Heart ( 2nd Oak Leaf Clusters), 2 Army Commendation Medal with ‚ÄúV‚Äù device ( 2nd Oak Leaf Cluster) Army Achievement Medal (3rd Oak Leaf Cluster), Afghanistan Service Medal, Iraqi Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (with Arrowhead), Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Noncommissioned Officer Development Ribbon (with numeral 3), Overseas Service Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, the Army Good Conduct Medal (3rd Award), Ranger Tab, Senior Parachutist Badge (with Bronze Combat Jump Star), Expert Infantryman‚Äôs Badge, and the Combat Infantryman‚Äôs Badge.

&nbsp;

SFC Kapacziewski is married to the former Miss Kimberly Smithwick, from Moultrie, Georgia. They have two wonderful sons, Wyatt, 3 years of age and Cody, 2 years of age.

Stiglitz was born in Gary, Indiana in 1943. A graduate of Amherst College, he received his PHD from MIT in 1967, became a full professor at Yale in 1970, and in 1979 was awarded the John Bates Clark Award, given biennially by the American Economic Association to the economist under 40 who has made the most significant contribution to the field. He has taught at Princeton, Stanford, MIT and was the Drummond Professor and a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He is now University Professor at Columbia University in New York and Chair of Columbia University's Committee on Global Thought. He is also the co-founder and Executive Director of the Initiative for Policy Dialogue at Columbia. In 2001, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for his analyses of markets with asymmetric information, and he was a lead author of the 1995 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.

Stiglitz was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1993-95, during the Clinton administration, and served as CEA chairman from 1995-97. He then became Chief Economist and Senior Vice-President of the World Bank from 1997-2000. In 2008, he was appointed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to chair a Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Economic Progress.

Stiglitz holds a part-time appointment at the University of Manchester as Chair of the Management Board and Director of Graduate Summer Programs at the Brooks World Poverty Institute. He serves on numerous other boards, including Amherst College's Board of Trustees and Resources for the Future.

Stiglitz helped create a new branch of economics, "The Economics of Information," exploring the consequences of information asymmetries and pioneering such pivotal concepts as adverse selection and moral hazard, which have now become standard tools not only of theorists, but of policy analysts. He has made major contributions to macro-economics and monetary theory, to development economics and trade theory, to public and corporate finance, to the theories of industrial organization and rural organization, and to the theories of welfare economics and of income and wealth distribution. In the 1980s, he helped revive interest in the economics of R&amp;D.

His work has helped explain the circumstances in which markets do not work well, and how selective government intervention can improve their performance.

Recognized around the world as a leading economic educator, he has written textbooks that have been translated into more than a dozen languages. He founded one of the leading economics journals, <em>The Journal of Economic Perspectives</em>. His book <em>Globalization and Its Discontents</em> (W.W. Norton June 2001) has been translated into 35 languages, besides at least two pirated editions, and in the non-pirated editions has sold more than one million copies worldwide. Other recent books include <em>The Roaring Nineties</em> (W.W. Norton), <em>Towards a New Paradigm in Monetary Economics</em> (Cambridge University Press) with Bruce Greenwald, <em>Fair Trade for All </em>(Oxford University Press), with Andrew Charlton, and <em>Making Globalization Work</em>, (WW Norton and Penguin/ Allen Lane, September 2006).

<div>Josh Swiller has been a hospice worker, a Peace Corps volunteer, a forest ranger, a sheepskin craftsman, an internationally recognized advocate, a raw food chef and a Zen monk, among other things.¬† He has also been deaf since the age of four.¬† Currently, he works at Gallaudet University, where he is leading the effort to secure more attention, care and understanding for the tens of thousands of young veterans returning from courageous service in Iraq and Afghanistan with severe hearing loss.¬† He also runs Access International Foundation, which strives to improve the support and visibility of the deaf and disabled throughout the world.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>The Unheard</em>, Josh‚Äôs memoir of growing up deaf and living for two years in a rural African Village beset with contagious disease, endemic corruption and witchcraft, as well as an appalling lack of toilet paper has been lauded for its compassion, humor, and literary skill.¬† It was a New York Times bestseller and has been optioned for a movie.</div>

<div>In his speeches, Josh shares from his many experiences ‚Äì anecdotes that range from outright hysterical (being sued in tribal court for virginity theft) to terrifying (being sued in court for virginity theft).¬† He reflects on all his journeys -- not just the ones to five continents but also those through varied and unexpected sense worlds (once deaf, he now hears remarkably well through a computer implanted in his skull).¬† He takes a hard look at the plight of the hundreds of millions of deaf and disabled around the world ‚Äì how they are seen and not-seen in various cultures.¬† He maps strategies for improving their situations, concentrating on day-to-day, here-and-now steps we can take to create a more accepting and compassionate world.¬† All this is done with humor and compassion, which touches on the core of Josh‚Äôs message--one rooted in years of monastic spiritual practice.</div>

He is the author of¬†many books, including <em>Inside the Mind of Casey Anthony, </em>the <em>New York Times </em>true crime bestseller <em>Inside the Mind of Scott Peterson</em><em>; the New York Times </em><em>self-help bestseller </em><em>The 7: Seven Wonders that Will Change Your Life</em> (co-written with Glenn Beck); and <em>Without Mercy: The Shocking True Story of a Doctor Who Murdered</em>, about a California doctor who killed one of Ablow‚Äôs good friends.

<div>The New York Times hailed Ken Burns as ‚Äúthe most accomplished documentary filmmaker of his generation.‚Äù ‚ÄúMore Americans get their history from Ken Burns than any other source,‚Äù said late historian Stephen Ambrose. With almost twenty documentaries to his name, Ken has earned countless awards and nominations, ranging from Oscars to Peabodys.</div>
<div></div>
<div>His first feature film, ‚ÄúBrooklyn Bridge‚Äù (1981), about the heroic completion of the largest bridge of its era, was nominated for an Academy Award. He followed this early success with a string of several historical documentaries: ‚ÄúThe Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God,‚Äù ‚ÄúStatue of Liberty,‚Äù ‚ÄúHuey Long,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Congress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThomas Hart Benton.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 1990, Ken Burns served as the director, producer, co-writer, chief cinematographer, music director and executive producer of the epic television series ‚ÄúThe Civil War,‚Äù which aired on PBS in nine episodes. ‚ÄúThe Civil War‚Äù was the highest rated television series in the history of American public television at the time, with an audience of 40 million during its premier. Columnist George Will said about the series, ‚ÄúIf better use has ever been made of television, I have not seen it and do not expect to see better until Ken Burns turns his prodigious talents to his next project.‚Äù The series was awarded with over 40 major film and television awards, including two Emmy Awards, two Grammys Awards, a People‚Äôs Choice Award, a Peabody Award, a D.W. Griffiths Award, and the $50,000 Lincoln Prize.</div>
<div></div>
<div>His next major project, ‚ÄúBaseball,‚Äù covered the entire history of baseball from the 1840‚Äôs to the late 1990‚Äôs. It premiered on PBS in 1994 and became the most watched series in PBS history, with over 45 million viewers. The Daily News said that the series ‚Äúresonates like a Mozart symphony.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ken continued to produce and direct critically acclaimed historical documentaries, ‚ÄúThe West,‚Äù Thomas Jefferson,‚Äù ‚ÄúLewis and Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery,‚Äù ‚ÄúFrank Lloyd Wright,‚Äù ‚ÄúNot for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &amp; Susan B. Anthony.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 2001, Ken directed his third epic documentary, ‚ÄúJazz,‚Äù which traced the American art form‚Äôs transformations through the decades. Tom Brokaw said, ‚Äú‚ÄôJazz‚Äô is a masterpiece of American television.‚Äù Jack Newfield of the New York Post said, ‚ÄúJazz is the best American documentary film I have ever seen. Period.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ken‚Äôs second war film, ‚ÄúThe War‚Äù aired on PBS in 2007. This poignant feature on World War II follows the lives of four people throughout the U.S. who were all affected by the devastation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>His most recent project, ‚ÄúThe National Parks: America‚Äôs Best Idea‚Äù will air on PBS September, 2009 in six episodes.</div>

<div>Ken Wells is a journalist and novelist who grew up in a snake-collecting family on the banks of the Bayou Black, LA., deep in Cajun country.¬† He began his writing career as a 19-year-old college dropout covering car wrecks and gator sightings for his semiweekly hometown paper, the Houma Courier.¬† He eventually got his B.A. in English and left the bayous in 1975 for the University of Missouri School of Journalism, graduating with honors from the master's program in 1977.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He went on to the Miami Herald where in 1982 he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for a series on how a multibillion-dollar draining system serving agribusiness was helping decimate parts of the Everglades. Wells joined The Wall Street Journal that same year in it's San Francisco bureau and roamed the West covering stories as disparate as polygamy in Utah and the Exxon Valdez Alaska oil spill, and contributing regularly to the paper's popular Page One "middle column" feature. He moved to the London bureau in 1990, in time to help out with the paper's reportage of the first Persian Gulf War. He traveled widely in Africa and wrote extensively about South Africa's transition to a nonradical democracy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wells transferred to New York in 1993, where he joined the paper's Page One staff as a writer and editor, eventually running a team of reporters that wrote exclusively for the front page. Two of his team, Tony Horwitz and Angelo Henderson, went on to win Pulitzer Prizes. Ken left the paper in October 2006 after 24 years to join Conde Nast Portfolio as a senior editor. Wells' literary commitment to his bayou home runs deep. He is the author of four well-received novels of Cajun Louisiana: Meely LaBauve, Junior's Leg, Logan's Storm, and Crawfish Mountain, a picaresque satire of political skullduggery and Big Oil shenanigans in the Louisiana wetlands. He is also editor of two anthologies of Journal "middle column stories," Floating Off the Page and Herd on the Street.</div>

Kristin was born in September 1960 in Southern California and grew up at the beach, and moved to Washington State at the age of eight.

After working in a trendy advertising agency,¬†Kristin decided to go to law school.¬†When she¬†was in my third-and final-year of law school and¬†her mother was in the hospital, facing the end of her long battle with cancer.¬†For the next few months, Kristin and her mother collaborated on the worst, most clich√©d historical romance ever written.

After¬†after her¬†death, Kristin packed up all those bits and pieces of paper they had collected and put them in a box in the back of my closet.¬†She got married and continued practicing law.

She then¬†found out¬†she was pregnant,¬†and was¬†on bed rest for five months. Her husband reminded¬†her of the book¬†she¬†had¬†started with¬†her mom. She pulled out the boxes of research material, dusted them off and began writing. By the time her son was born,¬†she had¬†finished a first draft and found an obsession.

Now, Kristin is a major bestselling novelist.¬† She continues to live in the Washington state with her family.

&nbsp;

Larry is renowned for both his literary achievements and political activism. At the root of both is his life-long commitment to criticizing and correcting gay apathy and government and social indifference to AIDS. He is a founder of Gay Men‚Äôs Health Crisis, an AIDS service organization, and ACT UP, a widely effective direct action AIDS advocacy group. Larry‚Äôs most acclaimed plays include <em>The Normal Heart</em> (1985) and the Pulitzer Prize-finalist <em>The Destiny of Me</em> (1992). His screenplay for <em>Women in Love</em> was nominated for an Academy Award in 1969. He is also well-known for his influential novel <em>Faggots</em> (1978), a confrontational portrayal of gay culture, and his critical essay about the AIDS crisis, ‚Äú1,112 and Counting‚Äù (1983).

&nbsp;

Larry has also written the plays <em>Sissie‚Äôs Scrapbook</em>, <em>A Minor Dark Age</em>, and <em>Just Say No, A Play about Farce</em>. His other books are <em>The Tragedy of Today‚Äôs Gays</em> and <em>Reports From the Holocaust: The Story of an AIDS Activist</em>.

&nbsp;

The recent Broadway revival of <em>The Normal Heart</em> was nominated for five Tonys and won three, including Best Play. The forthcoming film version of <em>The Normal Heart</em> will star Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts. A revival of <em>The Destiny of Me</em> will be directed by Joe Mantello. And <em>The Normal Heart</em> will begin its cross country tour shortly.

&nbsp;

Her on-screen beauty, as well as her trademark sultry voice, has made her an icon for several generations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacall was born in 1924 as Betty Joan Perske, the only daughter of Jewish immigrants William Perske and Natalie Weinstein-Bacall, who divorced when Bacall was six years old.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a teenager, Bacall was a part-time model and a movie usherette. The wife of legendary producer and director Howard Hawks‚Äô noticed Bacall modeling on the cover of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, and urged her husband to call her for a screen test. She made her film debut at only 19 years old opposite Humphrey Bogart in ‚ÄúTo Have and Have Not.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacall went on to marry Bogart in 1945, and starred with him in a second movie (also directed by Hawks), ‚ÄúThe Big Sleep.‚Äù Her character, the wealthy Vivian, showed powerful development of Bacall‚Äôs skills on screen. Her versatility as an actress was exemplified in her third film opposite Bogart, John Huston‚Äôs ‚ÄúKey Largo,‚Äù where she played a more vulnerable character.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bacall often took time off between each film to spend time with her family, even during the peak of her career activity in the 50‚Äôs. During this decade, Bacall appeared in such films as ‚ÄúHow to Marry a Millionaire‚Äù (1953) and ‚ÄúWritten on the Wind‚Äù (1956). Bogart died in 1957, the same year Bacall starred in the sophisticated comedy, ‚ÄúDesigning Woman.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 1960, she married actor Jason Robard. She seldom appeared on screen in the 1960‚Äôs, opting to make a return to the stage (where she had made brief appearances as a teenager) instead. She ended her eight year hiatus in 1974 with her role in the movie, ‚ÄúMurder on the Orient Express.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div>Throughout her career, Bacall has been presented with countless awards and honors, from a Tony Award in 1970 to the Bette Davis Medal of Honor in 2008. In 1997, Bacall received a Golden Globe for her role in ‚ÄúThe Mirror Has Two Faces.‚Äù The Stockholm Film Festival presented her with its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000, and the American Film Institute named Bacall as one of its 50 Greatest American Screen Legends in 2005.</div>
<div></div>
Bacall has written two autobiographies, best-selling <em>Lauren Bacall: By Myself</em> (1978), which won a National Book Award in 1980, and <em>Now</em> (1994). She continues her career today, starring in award-winning movies such as Lars von Trier‚Äôs ‚ÄúDogville‚Äù (2003).";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"Lauren Bacall";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:13:"lauren-bacall";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2012-11-12 21:33:20";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2012-11-12 21:33:20";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:62:"http://localhost/macmillian_site/?post_type=speaker&#038;p=117";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:7:"speaker";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:164;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"598";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"4";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2012-12-18 18:19:44";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2012-12-18 18:19:44";s:12:"post_content";s:1360:"<div id="ctl00_cphMainContent_divSpeakerDesc">

He is a three-time Moth StorySLAM champion who speaks to enthusiastic audiences dozens of times a year, as well as the host of another storytelling series called Speak Up!, in Connecticut.

&nbsp;

A public school teacher with more than 15 years of experience, Matthew was named West Hartford‚Äôs Teacher of the Year in 2005 and was one of three finalists for Connecticut‚Äôs Teacher of the Year. He has been a leader in the integration of the arts, technology and motivational practices in the classroom and is considered an expert at the teaching of writing to students of all ages. Matthew has also spent the last decade working with autistic and special needs students, and his 2012 novel, Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend, has been hailed as an accurate, unflinching and empathetic examination of the autistic child.

&nbsp;

Matthew is the author of three novels: Something Missing; Unexpectedly, Milo; and Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend, as well as the upcoming The Perfect Comeback of Caroline Jacobs. He has published essays in the Los Angeles Times, Hartford Courant, Orlando Sentinel, Houston Chronicle, The Christian Science Monitor and The Huffington Post, and has also written a rock opera, The Clowns. His novels have been translated into more than twenty languages and all have been optioned for film and television. Matthew‚Äôs first novel, Something Missing, was plucked from the slush pile, giving him insight into the process of finding a literary agent, launching a writing career and learning about the publishing from a fledgling author‚Äôs perspective.

Known for his ability to deliver humorous, candid and inspirational talks to writers of every age and ability level, Matthew has led a life of uncommon challenges, providing him with insight and wisdom that has been embraced by his audiences.

These experiences have provided Matthew with a perspective that has allowed him to connect inspirationally and motivationally to audiences ranging from 10-year-olds, to literary festival groups, and academic and professional associations.

May Pang, famous confidante to John Lennon, has been in the public eye for over three decades.

Pang‚Äôs career in the music industry spans over 25 years, starting with Allen Klein's company Abkco Industries, a firm which managed the Beatles Apple Corps. Ltd and the Rolling Stones. In 1970, she was selected by John Lennon and Yoko Ono to serve as their assistant in the United States.¬†Her responsibilities encompassed liaising with record companies and press as well as all other activities surrounding the lives of the Lennons. Pang also played a key role in the production of records by John, Yoko and Harry Nilsson. In 1974, she received a gold album for John Lennon's LP, Walls and Bridges" which represented John's first record to reach number one in both the singles and album charts.

In the late 1970's she continued her involvement in the music industry at Island Records where she coordinated all activities related to the release of albums by Robert Palmer, Third World, Bob Marley and the Wailers.

Pang became one of the leading professional managers of the music publishing industry during the early 1980's while at United Artists Music and Famous Music.¬† Working with several unknown songwriters, she was successful in obtaining coverage for them by such artists as Diana Ross, Judas Priest, The Four Tops and Air Supply. During this period, determined to set the record straight about her relationship with John Lennon, Warner Books published <em>Loving John</em> in 1983, a book which detailed her liaison and working association with the late Beatle, as well as his relationships with Paul, Ringo, George and his son, Julian.

Over the last two decades, she has appeared in every major news publication worldwide, and has been a guest on many national US TV shows, including the Howard Stern Show, Entertainment Tonight, CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America, Court TV, Geraldo and Joan Rivers to name but a few.

In the late 1980's, Pang emerged as one of the few individuals who could provide insight into John Lennon as well as an understanding and perspective on the resurgence of the Beatles popularity. Her latest book, the 2008 <em>Instamatic Karma</em>, has received international acclaim including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>LA Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post</em>.

Pang is also a talented designer, having created a unique line of Feng Shui Furniture and Jewelry available through her website. She is currently exhibiting photos of John Lennon and friends from her private collection.

A high school dropout, who once lived homeless on the streets, Michael Parness is now a hero to investors and traders everywhere. Michael is chief executive officer and founder of TrendFund.com, the leading online trend-based advisory service for the individual trader. Launched in 1999, Trendfund.com has over 100,000 customers in over 40¬†countries worldwide.

Over a ten-year period, Michael built Waxman into New York's top provider of sports collector's items. After taking a broker-friend's bad advice and losing his life savings, he developed an interest in the financial markets, and spent his spare time researching market trends and developing his own theories on market behavior.

Determined to earn back his losses and vowing to never use a broker again, Michael began trading for himself, with the moniker "Waxie." Making use of the skills and instincts he cultivated through years of careful research, Michael turned $33,000 into more than seven million dollars in less than three years.

His "Trend Trading To Win" infomercial has sold over 100,000 trading courses around the world on how to make money in any market.

An award-winning playwright, Michael's work has been produced extensively in New York and Los Angeles. In 2006 he co-founded Full Glass Films and has since written and directed Crazy for Love (David Krumholz, Lorraine Bracco, Rosanna Arquette), and produced Gospel Hill (Samuel L.Jackson, Danny Glover, Julia Stiles &amp; Angela Bassett), Foreign Exchange, The Insurgents, and Jake's Run.¬† In addition, Dustin Hoffman optioned Michael's life story and it is currently being cast for a potential 2009 lens date.¬† Michael's been honored at the United Nations for his charity work with children, and his Trend Fund Foundation has helped many abused and disenfranchised kids seek a better life.

&nbsp;

Michael, 45, after returning to school, finally graduated Summa Cum Laude from Hunter College in New York City, and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in English. He lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side where he continues to rule the freakin' markets every day!

Mike Edison has a resume that will make some people jealous, and others simply blush. He is the former publisher of High Times magazine and was the editor-in-chief of the irresponsibly outrageous Screw. He is a former Hustler and Penthouse correspondent, an internationally notorious musician, and a professional wrestler of no small repute. He is the author of 28 pornographic novels and the riotous memoir, <em>I Have Fun Everywhere I Go:¬† Savage Tales of Pot, Porn, Punk Rock, Pro Wrestling, Talking Apes, Evil Bosses, Dirty Blues, American Heroes, and the Most¬†Notorious Magazines in the World</em>.
<div>

<em>I Have Fun Everywhere I Go </em>is a rollicking, high-octane, always irreverent journey through the seamy side of the publishing industry. An Ivy League dropout who‚Äôs never looked back, Edison embarked on a career that‚Äôs seen him go undercover at a religious cult; on a bender with Evel Knievel; feuding with Hulk Hogan; smoking dope with Ozzy Osborne. As the publisher of High Times, he battled almost daily with a rainbow brigade of unrepentant hippies plagued with short-term memory loss, and owners who treated their employees more like the tenants of a halfway house for potheads than a team of professional editors and writers, all while leading the magazine to record heights in sales and advertising.

Edison is an expert on Free Speech, pornography, and the American counterculture. He is a ‚Äúdazzling story teller‚Äù (New York Press) and his events are legendary for being hilarious and often filthy while at the same time¬†‚Äúproof positive that one can be both edgy and erudite, lowbrow and literate, and take joy in the unbridled pleasures of the id without sacrificing the higher mind.‚Äù (PopMatters.com)

</div>
If that weren't enough, he was the producer of one of the worst B-movies of all time and a bona-fied YouTube superstar. Edison‚Äôs life is the very paradigm of being in the moment, shaking loose the leash of a complacent society, and rebelling without remorse. He has been compared to Hunter Thompson and Lenny Bruce, and there are no signs of him slowing down. He lives and works in New York City.

For anyone who has any interest in pop culture, sex, marijuana, free speech, and rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll, or who has any interest in journalism or wants to work for a magazine (or just find out what happens behind the curtain), Mike Edison is the perfect speaker.

&nbsp;

In April 2003, Ritland‚Äôs 16-member SEAL Team was deployed to Iraq along with the First Marine Division, and they were tasked with taking the city of Tikrit. During one clearing operation, he observed a group of Marines approaching a cave-like structure in a rural area outside the city. After searching thousands of buildings and similar structures without issue, the temptation was to assume that all was clear, but the platoon was alerted to danger by an explosive-detector dog. Ritland learned later that a grenade booby trap had been set in the doorway and would certainly have killed the first marines to enter. He knew instantly that he wanted to work with dogs such as the one he‚Äôd seen, and learn to harness their remarkable abilities to defeat the tools of modern warfare.

&nbsp;

After 12 years of active duty as a U.S. Navy SEAL, Ritland became a BUD/S instructor and then started¬†his own¬†company, Trikos International,¬†to train¬†dogs for the SEAL teams. Today he continues to supply working and protection dogs to a host of clients, including to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs, Border Patrol, TSA and the Department of Defense. He has trained hundreds of working dogs, and has over 15 years of experience in importing, breeding, raising, and training multiple breeds of working dogs. He also started the Warrior Dog Foundation to help retired Special Operations dogs live long and happy lives after their service.

Nena Baker is the author of <em>The Body Toxic: How the Hazardous Chemistry of Everyday Things Threatens Our Health and Well-being</em>, an ‚Äúeye-opening expose‚Äù (Seattle Post Intelligencer) that sifts through the latest findings about the hazards of everyday chemicals in consumer products. The Washington Post heralded¬†the book¬†as ‚Äúilluminating and consumer-oriented,‚Äù and Baker pulls no punches in her analysis of the corporate irresponsibility and regulatory failures that have created an environmental and public health crisis no less sweeping than global climate change. Baker speaks frequently about the topic of her book as a keynoter and panelist.

Formerly an investigative reporter at The Arizona Republic and The (Portland) Oregonian, Baker is known for hard-hitting stories. Her reports about factories in Indonesia where Nike sneakers are made helped spur the shoe giant to reconsider its responsibilities and led to numerous improvements for workers in the 1990's. Earlier in her career, Baker was a financial reporter and editor for United Press International in New York. She was a Davenport Business Journalism Fellow at the University of Missouri and was recipient of a Pew Center grant for a series of stories about non-voters. She is a graduate of Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon, where she currently makes her home.

Patti Callahan Henry grew up in Philadelphia, the daughter of an Irish minister, and moved south with her family when she was 12 years old. With the idea that being a novelist was ‚Äúunrealistic,‚Äù she set her sights on becoming a pediatric nurse, graduating from Auburn University with a degree in nursing, and from Georgia State with a Master‚Äôs degree in Child Health. She left nursing to raise her first child, Meagan, and not long after having her third child, Rusk, she began writing down the stories that had always been in her head. Henry wrote early in the mornings, before her children woke for the day, but it wasn‚Äôt until Meagan, then six, told her mother that she wanted ‚Äúto be a writer of books‚Äù when she grew up, that Henry realized that writing was her own dream as well. She began taking writing classes at Emory University, attending weekend writers‚Äô conferences, and educating herself about the publishing industry, rising at 4:30 AM to write.

They wanted to prove to the world that people with Type 1 diabetes were capable of racing just as well as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people. In 2006, Team Type 1 competed in the highly competitive and demanding Race Across America (RAAM), winning the first of two corporate team division titles. They did it again the following year, cycling over 3,000 miles in just over five days.</div>

Dauch, an executive with nearly thirty years in the trenches of the hard-nosed Detroit automobile industry, had long dreamed of running his own manufacturing company. From his first job on the plant floor at General Motors to his crucial role in helping to rescue Chrysler from the brink of bankruptcy, Dauch focused passionately, and relentlessly, on quality, productivity, and flexibility in manufacturing. In 1993 he took on the challenge of his life, buying a lagging axle supply and parts business from GM, along with five rusting, unprofitable, union-controlled, near-decrepit plants in the heart of a crime-ridden Detroit and a deteriorating environment in Buffalo, New York.

The newly created "stand-alone" company was named American Axle and Manufacturing. Dauch set out to create a world-class industrial automotive manufacturer. He altered the surrounding landscape and upward educated, trained, and expanded the skill sets of the workforce, struck tough bargains with unions, and solved massive quality problems that were costing tens of millions every year and undermining customer satisfaction.Within one year of opening the doors, AAM had turned an astounding $66 million in profit.

Tough, smart, inspiring, high-energy, and opinionated, Dauch offers memorable lessons on leadership, advanced product technology, communication, negotiation, and making profits in the most difficult times. His story transcends the auto industry and draws a blueprint for job creation, manufacturing competitiveness, economic growth, and excellence in America. He has lectured extensively on the subject of world-class manufacturing, economic growth, leadership, and negotiation skills.Mr. Dauch was the 2006 recipient of the Shien-Ming Wu Foundation Manufacturing Leadership Award. In 2005, he received the CEO Legend Award from Automation Alley. In 2003, he received the Harvard Business School Club of Michigan Business Statesman Award, the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award, and the Northwood University Outstanding Business Leader Award. In 1999, he was named the Michiganian of the Year by The Detroit News and he was named the 1997 Manufacturer of the Year by the Michigan Manufacturers' Association. In 1996, he was named Worldwide Automotive Industry Leader of the Year by the Automotive Hall of Fame.Politicians, voters, executives, and employees all want the answer to one question: How can America compete with cheap foreign labor, and restore skilled, well-paying jobs to our economy?

His humorous and distinct voice stems from his colorful career history: at only 33, Richie Frieman has seen almost everything to which manners can possibly apply‚Äîfrom a wild and unique career as a professional wrestler, to work as a children‚Äôs books writer and illustrator, a music columnist, inventor, and entrepreneur. Whether in the boardroom or in the wrestling ring, Frieman has experienced manners and etiquette at its best and at its most bizarre. As a result, Frieman‚Äôs outlook on modern manners is humorous, honest, and above all else, helpful. Having walked many miles in a number of different shoes, Frieman‚Äôs tales of etiquette dos and don‚Äôts span a broad category of topics.¬†He is founder and CEO of the award-winning music and lifestyle e-magazine, PensEyeView.com (PEV), which has featured nearly 1,000 consecutive interviews with a different artist every 48 hours‚Äîfrom emerging artists to Grammy Award winners‚Äîsince its inception three years ago. Frieman was awarded a Laureate medal (formerly known as the Smithsonian Award) for his work with PEV at the 2008 Computerworld Honors Program, after being nominated by the CEOs of Research In Motion, the creators of BlackBerry. Richie Frieman is also the author of two children‚Äôs books in his original "Terple the Turtle" series. "Terple ‚Äì The Sky is Just the Start" was named a finalist in the Indie Excellence Awards National Book Awards, and its follow-up, "Terple ‚Äì Always Dream Bigger," is the winner of the 2012 Gelett Burgess Children‚Äôs Book Award for Best Poetry and Rhyme book, and has also been awarded the Literary Classics Seal of Approval. With the two books as an avenue for charitable work, Frieman has done dozens of signings and readings for organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, Karma Dogs, Maryland Food Bank, The Ed Reed Foundation, the Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital and the world renowned Kennedy Krieger Children‚Äôs Hospital. In addition to encouraging children to fulfill their dreams,¬†Frieman backs them by offering a portion of the profits from his book (for the life of it) to charity.

Frieman attended The University of Maryland College Park, graduating in 2001 with a degree in Fine Arts and a concentration in graphic design. Having shown work professionally in sculpture, painting and illustration, Frieman is also an active entrepreneur.

Rick Atkinson is completing volume three of his Liberation Trilogy, a narrative history of the U.S. military‚Äôs role in the liberation of Europe in World War II. The first volume, <em>An Army at Dawn: The War in North Africa, 1942-1943</em>, received the Pulitzer Prize and was acclaimed by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> as ‚Äúthe best World War II battle narrative since Cornelius Ryan‚Äôs classics, <em>The Longest Day</em> and <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>.‚Äù The second volume, <em>The</em> <em>Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944</em>, drew praise from the <em>New York Times</em> as ‚Äúa triumph of narrative history, elegantly written‚Ä¶and rooted in the sight and sounds of battle.‚Äù The final volume of the Liberation Trilogy, covering the last year of the European war, from Normandy to Berlin, will be published in May 2013.

&nbsp;

Atkinson is also the best-selling author of <em>The Long Gray Line</em>, a narrative saga about the West Point class of 1966, and <em>Crusade</em>, a narrative history of the Persian Gulf War. He also wrote <em>In the Company of Soldiers</em>, an account of his time with General David H. Petraeus and the 101st Airborne Division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003; the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> called the book ‚Äúthe most intimate, vivid, and well-informed account yet published‚Äù on that war, and <em>Newsweek</em> cited it as one of the ten best books of 2004.

&nbsp;

Atkinson‚Äôs many awards include the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for history; the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting; and the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for public service, awarded to the <em>Washington</em> <em>Post</em> for a series of investigative articles directed and edited by Atkinson on shootings by the District of Columbia police department. He is winner of¬† the 1989 George Polk Award for national reporting and the 2007 Gerald R. Ford Award for Distinguished Reporting on National Defense. Atkinson has served as the Gen. Omar N. Bradley Chair of Strategic Leadership at the U.S. Army War College, where he remains an adjunct faculty member.

&nbsp;

Atkinson served as a reporter, foreign correspondent, and senior editor for 25 years at the<em> Washington Post</em>, where his most recent assignments were covering the 101st Airborne during the invasion of Iraq, and writing about roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007. Previously he served as the assistant managing editor for investigations, a position that gave him the responsibility of investigative reporting at the newspaper. Atkinson‚Äôs journalism career began at the Pittsburg (Kansas) <em>Morning Sun</em> in 1976; in 1977, he moved to the<em> Kansas City</em> <em>Times</em>, before going to the <em>Washington</em> <em>Post</em> in 1983. Among other assignments, he served as the <em>Post‚Äô</em>s Berlin bureau chief, covering not only Germany and NATO, but also spending considerable time in Somalia and Bosnia.

&nbsp;

Born in Munich, Germany, Atkinson is the son of a U.S. Army officer and grew up on military posts. He holds a master of arts degree in English literature from the University of Chicago.

In his compelling presentation, Robert Burton posits a revolutionary idea: despite how certainty feels, it is neither a conscious choice nor even a thought process.¬† Drawing from case studies and recent neuroscience advances, as well as such far-ranging subject material as the physics of baseball, high-stakes poker, and popular discussions of gut feelings and the nature of intuition, Burton challenges us to reexamine the theory that certainty and conviction are products of reason. ¬†Burton‚Äôs revolutionary message carries wide-ranging implications on how we view the world.¬† He is a truly unique speaker.

A graduate of Yale University and the University of California at San Francisco medical school, where he also completed his neurology residency, he was appointed, at age thirty-three, chief of the Division of Neurology at Mt. Zion-UCSF Hospital, where he subsequently became Associate Chief of the Department of Neurosciences. He is the author of the critically acclaimed book<em>, On</em><strong> </strong><em>Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You're Not</em>, and the neuroscience and culture column at<strong> </strong>Salon.com,<em> </em>Mind Reader.

Greenberg has served as pollster to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, South African Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Bolivian President Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada, and Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer.

Next year, he will bring out his new book, <em>Dispatches from the War Room: In the Trenches with Five Extraordinary Leaders</em>. He is also the author of <em>The Two Americas: Our Current Political Deadlock and How to Break It</em>, described by James Carville as "the most important book on American politics in my memory" and <em>Middle Class Dreams</em> that put the spotlight on ‚ÄúReagan Democrats‚Äù - key to the current U.S. election.

Greenberg works with corporate clients including BP, Boeing, Monsanto, Comverse, and United HealthCare. He has also advised the Business Roundtable, and the Athens Organizing Committee, helping Greece prepare for the 2004 Olympics.

Together with Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, Greenberg conducts bi-partisan surveys for National Public Radio on the main issues of the day.

He advised the Nobel-prize winning campaign to ban land mines and directed the year-long "People on War" project for the ICRC - a consultation with people in the principal war zones of the late 20th century. He was also a strategic consultant to the Climate Center of the Natural Resources Defense Council on its multi-year campaign on global warming.

Greenberg is co-founder with James Carville of Democracy Corps - a non-profit initiative providing opinion research and strategic advice to aid progressive organizations. He also served as principal polling advisor to the Democratic Leadership Council during the formative years of change (1988-1994) for the Democratic Party.

Greenberg has been described as "the father of modern polling techniques," ‚Äúthe De Niro of all political consultants," and ‚Äúan unrivaled international ‚Äòguru‚Äô." Esquire Magazine named him one of the most important people of the 21st century. The New York Times writes that Greenberg "acts as a sort of people's truth squad," while The New Republic describes Stan Greenberg‚Äôs list of clients as a "who's who in center-left world leaders." The New Yorker reported Ehud Barak‚Äôs victory in 1999 as either a "stunning upset for the country's Labor Party or...just another Greenberg client taking his place as the head of state."

Republican pollster Frank Luntz says "Stan Greenberg scares the hell out of me. He doesn't just have a finger on the people's pulse; he's got an IV injected into it. He's the best."

Greenberg began his work as a pollster in the 1980s and early 1990s conducting surveys for a number of key U.S. campaigns for Senators Chris Dodd, Joe Lieberman, and Jeff Bingaman; Governor Jim Florio and former Ambassador Andy Young; Vice President Walter Mondale; and for the congressional campaigns of Bob Carr, David Bonior, and Rosa DeLauro.

Greenberg founded Greenberg, Quinlan Rosner Research in 1980 after a decade of teaching at Yale University where he received a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Starre Vartan founded Eco Chick in October of 2005 with the idea that women who cared about the planet needed a place of their own on the web. At the time, most environmental blogs were guy-oriented, and very serious, and Vartan thought that while discussion of scientific issues was important, consumer action would be second only to policy shifts in protecting the environment and creating a more sustainable culture. Enabling individuals to clean up their lives also gives each and every person an opportunity to realize their impact natural environment, a principle imperative to real change.

Vartan considers herself an ‚ÄúEvangelist for the Earth,‚Äù and so far, so good. <em>The Eco Chick Guide to Life, How to Live Fabulously Green</em> debuted on August 18th, 2008 from St. Martin‚Äôs Press. Eco Chick and/or Starre (as a green living expert) has been featured in Glamour, Elle.com, Men‚Äôs Journal, ABC TV, FOX TV and The CW, The Wall Street Journal, The Christian Science Monitor, USA Today, Grist, Treehugger, MTV Switch, and a host of green blogs.

Vartan is currently Managing Editor for Greenopia, the rapidly expanding green listings and news site, and contributes regularly to The Huffington Post, who named her one of the 25 Hottest Green Girls (#9!) and named her one of the Top Green Twitter feeds. She loves writing the Green Guru column for Audubon Magazine, where she gets to don her ‚Äôsmarty-pants‚Äô to answer reader‚Äôs environmental questions every other month.

Vartan is also the style editor for Plenty Magazine, fashion and style columnist at Hearst‚Äôs The Daily Green and was the guest blogger for Elle.com during Earth Month, 2008. For four years, she was a contributing writer for E/The Environmental Magazine, the nation‚Äôs oldest independent environmental publication, and was a dining columnist for The Fairfield County Weekly, where she also regularly wrote about commuting, transportation, and alternative energy. She‚Äôs also written for Alternet.org, Worldchanging New York, and jewschool.com.

She is excited to have been an associate producer for the Discovery Channel‚Äôs upcoming mini-series, Final Hour, a parable about humanity‚Äôs impact on Earth‚Äôs ecosystems.

Vartan was born in Sydney, Australia, and spent long sojourns, summers and holidays Down Under. Contrasting with the sandstone cliffs, ocean culture and dry climate of the Sydney environs, she spent the balance of her younger years attending school in the tiny town of Garrison, New York. Situated in the Hudson Highlands, the lush woods, deep green lakes, and precipitous mountains of Garrison (not to mention the majestic Hudson River) still inspire her.

The environments of her youth and world travels led her to achieve a B.S. in Geology, a B.A. in English and a minor in Biology at Syracuse University. Vartan is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts in nonfiction writing at Columbia University. Starre has pursued these courses of study to both understand and better communicate the importance of the connections between the natural world and human life. Starre thinks that the health of the environment is the most pressing issue of our time.

Now residing in coastal Connecticut, Starre is an inveterate world traveler, vegetarian, artist, and animal lover. She loves the great outdoors, snowboarding in the winter, swimming in the summer and does crazy yoga poses and hikes all year long. She shares her home with three rescued cats and a crazy cocker spaniel.

<div>Stephen G. Bloom is the author of the forthcoming <em>Tears</em> <em>of Mermaids: The Secret Story of Pearls</em>, a swashbuckling Indiana Jones saga that takes readers around the globe on a dazzling adventure to track the world‚Äôs most extraordinary gems.</div>
<div>Bloom sought to trace a single pearl, from the moment a diver off the Northern Australian coast scoops up from the seafloor a oyster with a glistening pearl inside ‚Äî to the instant a woman 10,000 miles away fastens the clasp to a necklace containing the very same pearl.¬† The nonfiction detective saga uses pearls as a metaphor to explore interconnections of global politics, the environment, world finance, and haute couture.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bloom hired himself out as a pearling deckhand in the Timor Sea, tromped through Philippine jungles to reach one of the world‚Äôs great pearling-processing centers, fished for freshwater pearls in rural China, bargained in some of the globe‚Äôs great pearl bazaars, and got feted on remote island paradises of the world‚Äôs reigning pearl lords.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Pearls, Bloom writes, are not very different from cocaine.¬† Both are white, lightweight, portable, and can be hidden easily.¬† Both are grown in remote farms, patrolled by around-the-clock armed guards.¬† Both are free-traded; their prices based on everyday shifts in supply and demand, which makes for daily ticks up and down on an invisible yet real global stock market.¬† Per gram, high-quality pearls sell for about the same as pure cocaine.¬† Exceptional pearls sell for more.¬† The industries of both are controlled by fewer and fewer producers and distributors, buying out small, family-run farms, consolidating political and economic power.¬† The surviving owners today are men of extraordinary means and influence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A self-confessed lover of pearls, Bloom is a natural storyteller who weaves a remarkable tale about the world‚Äôs oldest and most enduring gems, and the women who have adored them ‚Äî from Cleopatra, Queen Isabella, and Coco Chanel to Jacqueline Kennedy, Audrey Hepburn, and Michelle Obama.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A professor of narrative writing at The University of Iowa, for more than two decades Bloom was an award-winning journalist for the Dallas Morning News, Los Angeles Times, San Jose Mercury News, and Sacramento Bee.¬† He was a foreign correspondent in Brazil for the Field News Service.¬† Bloom's essays have appeared in such publications as The New York Times, Washington Post, Smithsonian, London Guardian, Chicago Tribune, Wilson Quarterly, Annals of Clinical Psychiatry, DoubleTake, and Salon.¬† He has appeared on CBS Sunday Morning, ABC World News Tonight, the Diane Rehm Show, Michael Feldman‚Äôs Whad‚ÄôYa Know Public Radio show, National Public Radio‚Äôs Morning Edition and All Things Considered.¬† Bloom has been a writing fellow at the MacDowell Colony and Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, as well as a visiting scholar at Columbia University.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to <em>Tears of Mermaids</em>, Bloom is co-author (with Peter Feldstein) of <em>The Oxford Project</em>, author of <em>Postville: A Clash of Cultures in Heartland America</em>, and author of a collection of his nonfiction stories,<em> Inside the Writer's Mind</em>.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>The Oxford Project</em> was named to NPR‚Äôs list of Best Books of 2008, and received the coveted Alex Award from the American Library Association.¬† Filmmaker Ken Burns called <em>The Oxford Project</em>, a ‚Äúpowerful, confessional book that draws its strength from the truth that so-called ordinary people, not those with bold-faced names, are actually the heroes of our American drama."¬† Pulitzer Prize-winner Dale Maharidge praised <em>The Oxford Project</em> as "American documentary work at its finest."¬† Harvard University‚Äôs Nieman Reports wrote, ‚ÄúWhat we have in this spellbinding and ambitious and eccentric volume is <em>Our Town</em> and <em>Spoon River Anthology</em> updated and revivified. We also have journalism, in words and in images, at its heart-stopping best and its most poignant.‚Äù</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Postville </em>was named a Best Book of the Year by the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and Denver Rocky Mountain News.¬† Publisher‚Äôs Weekly cited <em>Postville</em> as ‚Äúa model of sociological reportage and personal journalism‚Ä¶An illuminating meditation on contemporary U.S. culture and what it means to be American.‚Äù¬† The New York Times called <em>Postville</em> ‚Äúriveting‚Ä¶A gripping portrayal of a confounding collision, an adjunct battle in the larger culture war, one that removes the question of diversity from the realm of abstraction and makes it prickly, difficult, and real.‚Äù¬† <em>Postville</em> is required reading in more than 150 university and college courses in the United States.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bloom, a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, lives in Iowa City, Iowa, with his wife and son.</div>

STEPHEN P. KIERNAN is an award-winning journalist and the author of <em>Authentic Patriotism: Restoring America‚Äôs Founding Ideals Through Selfless Action</em> and <em>Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System</em>. He speaks frequently to audiences across the country about health care, civic engagement, ethics, service learning, meaningful living, medical research, the green economy, criminal justice, race relations, the power of personal commitment, hospice, palliative care and advance directives.

He has won 40 awards, including the Gerald Loeb Award for financial journalism, the George Polk Award for medical reporting, and the Associated Press Managing Editors‚Äô Freedom of Information Award. Stephan has also taught at Middlebury College and the New England Young Writer‚Äôs conference.

She is also a nutrition consultant and coach for the popular Daniel Plan, the inspirational health movement led by Pastor Rick Warren, and including Dr. Daniel Amen, Dr. Mark Hyman, and Dr. Mehmet Oz. Followers of The Daniel Plan lost more than 125 tons in 2011.

Working alongside her husband, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and physician, Daniel Amen, MD, Tana offers nutritional guidance and practical support to hundreds of thousands of Amen followers. Her book, <i>The Omni Diet</i>, is the culmination of her decade-long quest to study relationship between food and the body, and to understand how proper nutrition not only impacts weight loss, but actually holds the key to reversing chronic disease, decreasing inflammation, healing the body, and dramatically improving quality of life.

By the time she had reached her mid-30s, Tana Amen had nearly given up on good health. Through a lifetime of chronic medical ailments, including severe digestive issues, recurrent infections and, most devastatingly, a battle with thyroid cancer, there was never a point when Tana felt consistently healthy. Doctors ascribed her poor health to genetics, bad luck, and a family history of obesity and heart disease‚Äîbut even when Tana committed to a standard fitness and eating regimen, her health failed to improve. That‚Äôs when she realized that she needed to figure out how to improve her health . . . for good.

Tana‚Äôs fresh approach, her energetic presence, her enthusiastic style, and her ability to connect personally and directly with people‚Äîeven in large groups‚Äîhave made her an in-demand speaker. Tana has given dozens of presentations at the Saddleback Church, Superhero You, High Performance Brains, Women‚Äôs Wellness, the Institute for the Advancement of Human Behavior, the Omega Institute, Beacon House, Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center, The Want Institute, and other wellness-focused organizations.

She shares healthy eating tips in her newsletter and blog on <a href="http://www.tanaamen.com/">www.TanaAmen.com</a>, <i>The Huffington Post</i>, and Livestrong.com. She is also a coach on The Amen Solution online community and answers questions via her blog on <a href="http://www.amenclinics.com/">www.AmenClinics.com</a>.

Tana has played an important part in Dr. Amen‚Äôs astonishingly successful PBS specials, which have raised more than $45 million for public television and have made Daniel Amen one of the country‚Äôs most respected doctors.

<div>As one of only 41 people in history to have reached both the North and South Poles on foot and a veteran of over a dozen mountain and polar expeditions, Tom Avery is one of the brightest stars amongst the current crop of international explorers.¬† Tom is probably best known for leading the expedition described by the Guinness Book of Records as "the fastest surface journey to the North Pole", which retraced Robert Peary and Matthew Henson‚Äôs footsteps to the "Top of the World."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom Avery was born in December 1975 in London, England and was brought up in Brazil and France.¬† His passion for adventure began at the age of eight when he first read about Captain Scott.¬† He knew then that his life wouldn't be complete until he followed his hero‚Äôs footsteps to the South Pole.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom took up climbing at age sixteen but it wasn't until university that his expedition career really took off; there, he organized and led expeditions to the Andes, New Zealand, the Alps, Tanzania, Patagonia and Morocco.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After graduating from Bristol University in England 1998 with a degree in Geography and Geology, he began a 15-month career as an accountant with Arthur Andersen.¬† Eventually forced to choose between the city and the mountains, Tom chose the mountains.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The pinnacle of Tom‚Äôs climbing career to date was in 2000 when he led a pioneering British expedition to a previously unexplored 20-mile mountain range close to China‚Äôs western border.¬† His team scaled nine unnamed virgin summits up to 20,000 feet high.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On December 28, 2002, days after his 27th birthday, Tom Avery became the youngest Briton to complete the perilous journey to the South Pole on foot.¬† His team also broke the South Pole Speed Record; using state of the art kites to power them across the ice, they covered the last 47 miles to the Pole in an amazing 31 hours.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In April 2005 Tom electrified the exploration world by recreating Robert Peary‚Äôs disputed 1909 expedition to the North Pole.¬† The five-strong team travelled in a similar style to Peary with teams of Eskimo dogs and replica wooden sledges.¬† Tom's ambitious aim was to prove the skeptics wrong and match Peary‚Äôs 37-day journey to the Pole.¬† After an epic dash across the most unforgiving environment on the planet, Tom‚Äôs exhausted team rewrote the history books by making it to the Pole with five hours to spare.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A born leader, this remarkable young man runs every expedition himself, organizing everything from the fundraising to the training to the logistics to the selection of his teams.¬† His expeditions have received a huge amount of international print and TV media coverage.¬† Tom's highly acclaimed first book, <em>Pole Dance</em>, was published in 2003.¬† <em>To the End of the Earth</em>, the story about his record-breaking North Pole expedition was published in March 2009.</div>

The Honorable Tom Ridge is the president and CEO of Ridge Global LLC. As the company's chief executive, he leads a team of international experts that helps businesses and governments address a range of needs throughout their organizations, including risk management and global trade security, strategic business generation, technology integration, event security, crisis management, campus security and other issues that encompass a diverse portfolio.

Following the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, Tom Ridge became the first Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and, on January 24, 2003, became the first Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The creation of the country‚Äôs 15th Cabinet Department marked the largest reorganization of government since the Truman administration and another call to service for the former soldier, congressman and governor of Pennsylvania.

During his tenure, Secretary Ridge worked with more than 180,000-plus employees from a combined 22 agencies to create an agency that facilitated the flow of people and goods, instituted layered security at air, land and seaports, developed a unified national response and recovery plan, protected critical infrastructure, integrated new technology and improved information sharing worldwide.¬† Tom Ridge served as Secretary of this historic and critical endeavor until February 1, 2005.

Before the events of September 11th, Tom Ridge was twice elected Governor of Pennsylvania.¬† He served as the state‚Äôs 43rd governor from 1995 to 2001. Known for his commitment to high standards and results, Governor Ridge delivered on his promise to make Pennsylvania "a leader among states and a competitor among nations." Governor Ridge's aggressive technology strategy helped fuel the state's advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.

Born August 26, 1945, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, Ridge was raised in a working-class family in veterans' public housing in Erie. He earned a scholarship to Harvard, graduating with honors in 1967.

After his first year at The Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served as an infantry staff sergeant in Vietnam, earning the Bronze Star for Valor, the Combat Infantry Badge and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. After returning to Pennsylvania and to Dickinson, he earned his law degree and was in private practice before becoming assistant district attorney in Erie County.

Tom Ridge was elected to Congress in 1982. He was one of the first Vietnam combat veterans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and was overwhelmingly re-elected by Pennsylvania voters five times.

An engaging and dynamic speaker, Secretary Ridge regularly addresses audiences throughout the world on issues, such as security, terrorism, global engagement, leadership, technology and more. Additionally, the first U.S. secretary of Homeland Security serves on the boards of the Institute for Defense Analyses, the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress and other private and public entities, and since 2005, has served as chairman of the National Organization on Disability. Secretary Ridge continues to contribute to matters concerning our nation‚Äôs veterans and, along with Gen. Tommy Franks (Ret.), serves as national co-chairman of the Flight 93 Memorial Fundraising Campaign.

Throughout his public and private sector career, Tom Ridge has received numerous honors, including the Woodrow Wilson Award, the Veterans of Foreign Wars‚Äô Dwight D. Eisenhower Award, the John F. Kennedy National Award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the American Bar Association‚Äôs John Marshall Award, the National Guard‚Äôs Harry S. Truman Award, the Pennsylvania Wildlife Federation‚Äôs Conservationist of the Year Award, U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs Good Neighbor Award, the American Cancer Society‚Äôs prestigious National Medal of Honor, the Mister Rogers Award, the Champion of Public Television Award, the Intrepid Freedom Award and the Esperanza Leadership Award. Secretary Ridge has also been awarded honorary degrees and awards from many national and international academic institutions.

There are theory specialists and then there are those who have been there. Troy Hazard, recent Global President of the elite Entrepreneurs' Organisation, has survived moments of sheer desperation in business. Drawing from a lifetime of innovative, real-life leadership experience, Hazard now shares with businesses his powerful Lessons from the Edge.

How do you make the right decision when you're faced with a situation you've never experienced before? What do your customers really want from your company and how do you ensure your relationships with your consumers are as strong as possible? How do you recognise trouble and change your strategy accordingly?

There are few situations in the business world that Troy Hazard has not experienced and survived ‚Äì from massive financial loss to stunning success. The entrepreneurial genius, who has founded and nurtured nine businesses over two decades, has been a few days from bankruptcy, has turned around businesses that were making enormous losses and has consulted to countless successful companies.

Hazard's business talents earned him international respect, so much so that he was elected by the worlds foremost business leaders for the role of Global President of the Entrepreneurs' Organisation, a role he says was one of his greatest challenges.

"That was by far the toughest leadership position I have held," he admits, speaking of an organisation that represents a global community of successful business owners. "I was leading leaders who lead leaders who lead people ‚Äì a large collection of the world's most brilliant business minds, and they all at some stage thought they could do the job better than I could. It was extremely challenging and rewarding, and thrilling at the same time."

Hazard's experiences in the business world have allowed him valuable insight into the workings of organisations and the minds of customers. Most business owners, for instance, believe they have a great relationship with their customers when in fact only twenty per cent really do. Why? Because business owners believe that, when a customer comes in to purchase a product or service, this constitutes a relationship. They assume their customers care about them!

It's this same experience that gives Hazard such great value as a Certified Professional Speaker. "Some of my businesses have failed and that has taught me many important lessons that you don't learn at business school," Hazard says. He drills down success into four key areas: understanding your own personal values, being a visionary leader, solid market positioning, and customer relationships. "The key thing about what I have to share is that I've done it¬† ‚Äì I'm speaking from experience, the good and the bad."

Troy‚Äôs Lessons from the Edge provide businesses with potent and refined tools, all of which have been road tested in real-world situations and none of which you will ever learn about in business school.

<div>William Becker, 62, is Executive Director of the Presidential Climate Action Project (PCAP), which has created a comprehensive plan for the next President of the United States to jump-start federal leadership on global warming during his first 100 days in office. PCAP, delivered to the Obama Transition Team in November 2008, has been called the Gold Standard of policy guidance for the incoming President.</div>
<div>Bill also directs two dynamic projects that have grown from PCAP: The Central Appalachia Prosperity Project is creating a plan for that region to make the transition from coal to a green economy; The Future We Want project is creating an interactive exhibit and world wide web site for the public to envision what the future will be like in a green society and to help design it.</div>
<div>
Prior to joining the University of Colorado Denver to direct these initiatives, Bill served as the Central Regional Director for the U.S. Department of Energy, where he and his staff of 30 helped spread the use of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in a 12-state area. During 15 years at DOE, he became the agency‚Äôs principal expert on sustainable community development.</div>
<div></div>
<div>While on sabbatical from DOE during 2005-2006, Becker served as senior advisor to the Global Energy Center for Community Sustainability at the Gas Research Institute and as an adjunct faculty member in the Colorado Energy Research Institute at the Colorado School of Mines.¬† He led a DOE-sponsored team of US experts to Beijing to consult with Chinese officials on the "greening" of the Olympic Village for the 2008 Games; participated on a DOE team that traveled to Thailand to advise the government on tsunami reconstruction; and served as an advisor to the Louisiana Energy Office on the sustainable reconstruction of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, one of the areas most damaged by Hurricane Katrina.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bill has worked with many other disaster-damaged communities to help them incorporate energy efficiency, renewable energy and sustainable design into their recoveries. After the Great Flood along the Mississippi River in 1993, he organized and led a team of sustainable development experts that assisted two communities in relocating from the floodplain and rebuilding on higher ground with sustainable designs and technologies. The projects were cited as prototypes of green community action by the President‚Äôs Council on Sustainable Development. In 1996, he founded and directed DOE's Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development and its Smart Communities Network web site, the "granddaddy" of sustainable community resources on the internet.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the 1970s, as the editor/publisher of the weekly newspaper¬† in Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, Bill proposed and helped implement a pioneering project to relocate much of the community from the floodplain of the Kickapoo River and build the nation's first "solar village". The project has been featured in the television documentaries Solar Town USA and River Town, as well as in several books, including two authored by Becker: Come Rain, Come Shine, and The Making of a Solar Village. Becker‚Äôs most recent book, The 100 Day Action Plan to Save the Planet, was published in October 2008 by St. Martin‚Äôs Griffin of New York. Today, 30 years later, Soldiers Grove is being cited as a model of what communities worldwide must do to in this time of global climate change: Adapt to impacts such as flooding and extreme weather events, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using clean and renewable energy technologies.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bill serves as senior advisor to Natural Capitalism Solutions Inc. and on the Board of Directors of the Public Sustainability Partnership in California. He serves on the Global and North American Advisory Boards for OgilvyEarth, a program in which one of the world‚Äôs largest communications firms is providing sustainability guidance for Fortune 100 companies. He is an advisor to the University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership and its flagship program, the Prince of Wales's Business &amp; the Environment Programme (BEP). He is a member of the Experts Advisory Group for the Institute for Environmental Security (The Hague), which is commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of the Environment and the United Nations Foundation to work on climate-related global policy coherence.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bill is a regular contributor to several prominent blogs on energy, climate and the environment including Huffington Post, Climate Progress, SolveClimate and the Environmentalist Magazine. He speaks frequently in the United States and Europe on the topics of climate change, national energy policy and the future.</div>
<div></div>
<div>During his diverse career, Bill has served as a war correspondent in South Vietnam, where he won a Bronze Star medal; writer/photographer for the Associated Press; publisher of his own weekly newspaper in rural Wisconsin; editorial writer and columnist for the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison, WI.; associate director of the Wisconsin Energy Extension Service; research director for the Wisconsin State Senate; executive assistant to the Wisconsin Attorney General; Counselor to the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration in Washington, DC; and communications director for the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In his spare time, Bill is a landscape photographer, blues guitarist and fly fisherman. He and his wife Mary live in Golden, Colorado.</div>
