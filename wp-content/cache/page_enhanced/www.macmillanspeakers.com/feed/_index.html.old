				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born and raised as part of the Independent Fundamental Baptist church, she was told with the other congregants that they must not associate with members of other Baptist denominations and evangelicals, and subscribe to insular marriages within the church, subservience for women, and highly unusual child-raising practices. In her book, <i>I Fired God</i>, Zichterman systematically details the IFB’s disturbing history, exposing a cult-like atmosphere of corruption, greed, and abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zichterman is currently an abuse advocate and whistleblower fighting against the IFB Church, and was a critical source for the ABC News <i>20/20</i> investigative hour <i>Shattered Faith</i> as well sa the “Ungodly Discipline” series featured on CNN’s <i>Anderson Cooper 360</i>. She also has been a source for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Huffington Post</i>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A writer and cultural anthropologist, Bateson is a visiting scholar at Boston College’s Center on Aging and Work. She was born in New York City in 1939 and lived there until 1956 when she traveled to Israel, leaning Hebrew and completing the Israeli matriculation exams. After she returned to the United States, she attended Radcliffe College and then when to graduate school at Harvard University, where she studied Arabic linguistics and Islamic history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her first teaching job was at Harvard, followed by two years in the Philippines and later in Iran. Bateson was Dean of the Faculty at Amherst College from 1980 to 1983, and from 1987 to 2002, she was the Claren J. Robinson Professor in Anthropology and English at George Mason University and became Professor <i>Emerita</i> in 2002. After that, she spent three years as Visiting Professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and also taught at Northeastern University and Spelman College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While her original research interest was in the Middle East, she has more recently been interested in how women and men work out distinctive ways of adapting to culture change, learning from those around them, and improvising new ways of being. This has led her to work with life histories and other types of first person narratives. Bateson was also president of the Institute for Intercultural Studies in New York City from 1979 to 2009. She has written and co-authored numerous books and articles as well as lectured across the country and around the world to professional and popular audiences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 25-year veteran New Jersey police officer, Mike Russell is internationally recognized from his HBO documentary, “Confessions of an Undercover Cop,” which aired in the United States from 1988 to 1991.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working undercover, Russell was infiltrating a Mafia crime family when a turn for the worst left him with a gunshot to the back of the head. Left to die in an alley, he survived and went on to orchestrate one of the biggest mafia takedowns of all time. Russell assimilated into the Genovese crime family in New Jersey by pretending to be an ex-cop fired for excessive force who now made his living from an oil delivery business. During this entire operation, he has consistently placed himself at risk and taken extraordinary steps to ensure his and his family’s safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russell speaks across the country in front of universities, police training academies, security corporations, and is the ideal technical advisor to feature in films and televisions. He takes crowds inside the day-to-day operations of cops from evidence gathering, to working wires, to street operations. An expert in his field, Mike Russell inspires and awes audiences with his experience in survival and adaptability.</p>
